Why should man expect his prayer for mercy to be heard by What is above him when he shows no mercy to what is under him? —Pierre Troubetzkoy (p.172/272) (Watts 255)

* He sighed. "Biochemistry is a tradeoff. The faster you synthesize ATP, the more expensive each
molecule becomes. It turns out scramblers are a lot more energy-efficient at making it than we are.
They're just extremely slow at it, which might not be a big drawback for something that spends most of its time inactive. Rorschach—whatever Rorschach started out as— could have drifted for millennia before it washed up here. That's a lot of time to build up an energy reserve for bouts of high activity, and once you've laid the groundwork glycolysis is explosive. Two-thousand-fold boost, and no oxygen demand."
* "You think Rorschach grows them on some kind of assembly line. You can't find any genes. Maybe they're just biomechanical machines."
