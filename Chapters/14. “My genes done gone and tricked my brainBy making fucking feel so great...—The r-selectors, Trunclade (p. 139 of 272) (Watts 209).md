“My genes done gone and tricked my brain

By making fucking feel so great

That’s how the little creeps attain

Their plan to fuckin’ replicate

But brain’s got tricks itself, you see

To get the bang but not the bite

I got this here vasectomy

My genes can fuck themselves tonight.”

—The r-selectors, Trunclade (p. 139/272) (Watts 209)

* Sarasti's logic. Vampire logic. We could follow it partway: the colossal deformation that had sealed Rorschach's breach was so much slower, so much more expensive than the dropgate that had trapped the Gang. The fact that dropgates hadn't been used implied that they took time to deploy—to redistribute necessary mass, perhaps, or spring-load its reflexes. That gave us a window. We could still venture into the den so long as the lions couldn't predict our destination and set traps in advance. So long as we got out again before they could set them afterwards.
* They didn't. But the blackened thing against the belly of Bates' machine was real enough. Not a
hallucination. Not even some understandable artefact of fear and synesthesia. Rorschach was
inhabited. Its inhabitants were invisible. Sometimes. Sort of. And, oh yeah. We'd just killed one.
