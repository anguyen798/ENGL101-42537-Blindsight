“My genes done gone and tricked my brain

By making fucking feel so great

That’s how the little creeps attain

Their plan to fuckin’ replicate

But brain’s got tricks itself, you see

To get the bang but not the bite

I got this here vasectomy
 My genes can fuck themselves tonight.”


—The r-selectors, Trunclade (p. 139/272) (Watts 209)

* r organism produce more children (biotic potential)

* "Because you can't protect your kids when they're lightyears away. They're on their own, and it's a big
cold dangerous universe so most of them aren't going to make it, eh? The most you can do is crank out
millions of kids, take cold comfort in knowing that a few always luck out through random chance. It's
not a mammal mind-set, Meesh. You want an earthbound simile, think of dandelion seeds. Or, or
herring."
A soft sigh. "So they're interstellar herring. That hardly means they can't crush us." (p. 81/272)
* emotional vasectomy
* Siri is addicted to being distant
* Afraid of intimacy

* Chelsea regarded it as love in its purest form. I came to think of it as hand-to-hand combat. Before,
whether fucking creations from my own menu or slip-on skins from someone else's, I had always
selected the contrast and the rez, the texture and the attitude. The bodily functions, the resistance of
competing desires, the endless foreplay that wears your tongue to the root and leaves your face sticky
and glistening—just kinks, today. Options for the masochistic.

* Sarasti's logic. Vampire logic. We could follow it partway: the colossal deformation that had sealed Rorschach's breach was so much slower, so much more expensive than the dropgate that had trapped the Gang. The fact that dropgates hadn't been used implied that they took time to deploy—to redistribute necessary mass, perhaps, or spring-load its reflexes. That gave us a window. We could still venture into the den so long as the lions couldn't predict our destination and set traps in advance. So long as we got out again before they could set them afterwards.
* They didn't. But the blackened thing against the belly of Bates' machine was real enough. Not a
hallucination. Not even some understandable artefact of fear and synesthesia. Rorschach was
inhabited. Its inhabitants were invisible. Sometimes. Sort of. And, oh yeah. We'd just killed one.
