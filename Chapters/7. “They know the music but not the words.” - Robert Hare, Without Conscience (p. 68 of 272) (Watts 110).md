* "That's true, Rorschach," Sascha admitted softly, taking a breath— And stepping forward. "So why don't you just suck my big fat hairy dick?"
* Rorschach remained invisible to Theseus, close as we were, close as we were coming. But parallax
stripped at least some of the scales from the probe's eyes; it woke to spikes and spirals of smoky glass flickering in and out of view, Ben's flat endless horizon semivisible through the intervening
translucence. The view trembled; waveforms rippled across ConSensus.
* "Rorschach to Theseus. Hello again, Theseus." The voice was female this time, and middle-aged.
* And suddenly Rorschach snapped into view—no refractory composites, no profiles or simulations in false color. There it was at last, naked even to Human eyes.
Imagine a crown of thorns, twisted, dark and unreflective, grown too thickly tangled to ever rest on
any human head. Put it in orbit around a failed star whose own reflected half-light does little more
than throw its satellites into silhouette. Occasional bloody highlights glinted like dim embers from its twists and crannies; they only emphasized the darkness everywhere else.
Imagine an artefact that embodies the very notion of torture, something so wrenched and disfigured that even across uncounted lightyears and unimaginable differences in biology and outlook, you can't help but feel that somehow, the structure itself is in pain.
Now make it the size of a city. It flickered as we watched. Lightning arced from recurved spines a thousand meters long. ConSensus showed us a strobe-lit hellscape, huge and dark and twisted. The composites had lied. It was not the least bit beautiful.
"Now it's too late," something said from deep inside. "Now every last one of you is dead. And Susan? You there, Susan? "We're taking you first."
