—Ian Anderson, Stand Up (p.189 of 272) (Watts 280)

Not in Theseus, anyway. The Gang hid in their tent. The transient lurked weightless and silent below
the surface. Bates was in the bridge— she more or less lived up there now, vigilant and conscientious,
nested in camera angles and tactical overlays. There was nowhere she could turn without seeing some
aspect of the cipher off our starboard bow. She did what good she could, for the good it would do.


Except Cunningham wasn't working. He hadn't even moved for at least four minutes. I'd assumed he
was reciting the Kaddish for Szpindel—ConSensus said he'd be doing it twice daily for the next year,
if we lived that long—but now, leaning to see around the spinal bundles in the core, I could read his
surfaces as clearly as if I'd been sitting beside him. He wasn't bored, or distracted, or even deep in
thought.


Robert Cunningham was petrified.

"Vision's mostly a lie anyway," he continued. "We don't really see anything except a few hi-res
degrees where the eye focuses. Everything else is just peripheral blur, just— light and motion. Motion
draws the focus. And your eyes jiggle all the time, did you know that, Keeton? Saccades, they're
called. Blurs the image, the movement's way too fast for the brain to integrate so your eye just—shuts
down between pauses. It only grabs these isolated freeze-frames, but your brain edits out the blanks
and stitches an — an illusion of continuity into your head."

"Are you listening, Keeton? Do you know what I'm saying?"
"You've figured out why I couldn't—you're saying these things can somehow tell when our eyes are
offline, and..."
I didn't finish. It just didn't seem possible.

"You're not listening. The trap you set wouldn't have caught anything like that, not unless it wanted to
be caught. We didn't grab specimens at all. We grabbed spies."


"—many other things it could have done," Cunningham was saying. "They could've induced Anton's
or, or an agnosia: then we could have tripped over a whole herd of scramblers and it wouldn't even
register in our conscious minds. Agnosias happen by accident, for God's sake. If you've got the senses
and reflexes to hide between someone's saccades, why stop there? Why not do something that really
works?"


"I think that first one was—you know it was a juvenile, right? Maybe it was just inexperienced. Maybe
it was stupid, and it made a bad decision. I think we're dealing with a species so far beyond us that
even their retarded children can rewire our brains on the fly, and I can't tell you how fucking scared
that should make you."

Cunningham's mouth moved in something that would have been a pitying smile if the rest of his face
had been able to join in. "He doesn't have to listen, Keeton. He doesn't have to spy on us. He just
knows."
Ventilators, breathing. The almost-subliminal hum of bearings in motion. Then Sarasti's disembodied
voice rang forth through the drum.


Cunningham swallowed and started again. "Those frayed motor nerves I couldn't figure out, those
pointless cross-connections—they're logic gates. Scramblers time-share. Their sensory and motor
plexii double as associative neurons during idle time, so every part of the system can be used for
cognition when it isn't otherwise engaged. Nothing like it ever evolved on Earth. It means they can do
a great deal of processing without a lot of dedicated associative mass, even for an individual."


Chelsea started growing a new skeleton. Her joints were calcifying within fifteen hours of exposure,
her ligaments and tendons within twenty. By then they were starving her at the cellular level, trying to
slow the bug by depriving it of metabolites, but they could only buy time and not much of it. Twenty-
three hours in, her striated muscles were turning to stone.
