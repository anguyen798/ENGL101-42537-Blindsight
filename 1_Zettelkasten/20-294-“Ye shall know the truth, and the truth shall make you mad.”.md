Siri is crucified because he needs pain
Something stabbed my hand like a spike at a crucifixion.
I screamed. Electric pain jolted to my shoulder. I yanked my hand back without thinking; the
embedded blade split its flesh like a fin through water. Blood sprayed into the air and stayed there, a
comet's tail of droplets tracing the frenzied arc of my hand.
Sudden scalding heat from behind. Flesh charred on my back. I screamed again, flailing. A veil of
bloody droplets swirled in the air.


Somehow I was in the corridor, staring dumbly at my right hand. It had been split to the heel of the
palm, flopped at the end of my wrist in two bloody, bifingered chunks. Blood welled from the torn
edges and wouldn't fall. Sarasti advanced through a haze of trauma and confusion. His face swam in
and out of focus, rich with his blood or mine. His eyes were bright red mirrors, his eyes were time
machines. Darkness roared around them and it was half a million years ago and I was just another
piece of meat on the African savannah, a split-second from having its throat torn out.



The vampire came after me, his face split into something that would have been a smile on anyone else.
"Conscious of pain, you're distracted by pain. You're fixated on it. Obsessed by the one threat, you
miss the other."


"So much more aware, so much less perceptive. An automaton could do better."


"Is this what you meant?" James cried from some dark irrelevant hiding place. "Is this your
preconditioning?"
Sarasti shook me. "Are you in there, Keeton?"


You invest so much in it, don't you? It's what elevates you above the beasts of the field, it's what
makes you special. Homo sapiens, you call yourself. Wise Man. Do you even know what it is, this
consciousness you cite in your own exaltation? Do you even know what it's for?
