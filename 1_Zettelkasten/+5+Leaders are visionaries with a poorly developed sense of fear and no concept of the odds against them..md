* Once there were three tribes. The Optimists, whose patron saints were Drake and Sagan, believed in a
universe crawling with gentle intelligenceâ€”spiritual brethren vaster and more enlightened than we, a
great galactic siblinghood into whose ranks we would someday ascend. Surely, said the Optimists,
space travel implies enlightenment, for it requires the control of great destructive energies. Any race
which can't rise above its own brutal instincts will wipe itself out long before it learns to bridge the
interstellar gulf.
