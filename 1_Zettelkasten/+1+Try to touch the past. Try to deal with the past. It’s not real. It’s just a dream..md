* At the age of eight, he was my best and only friend. We were fellow outcasts, bound by
complementary misfortune. Mine was developmental. His was genetic: an uncontrolled genotype that
left him predisposed to nearsightedness, acne, and (as it later turned out) a susceptibility to narcotics.
His parents had never had him optimized. Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also
held that one shouldn't try to improve upon His handiwork. So although both of us could have been
repaired, only one of us had been.
* But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring. I was still working up the algorithms to
get it back, still learning by observation. Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their midst.
Every child knows that much instinctively. Maybe I should just let that process unfold, maybe I
shouldn't try to mess with nature. Then again, Pag's parents hadn't messed with nature, and look what
it got them: a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs.
* In the end, propaganda worked where empathy failed. Back then
I didn't so much think as observe, didn't deduce so much as
remember—and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational
stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog.
* So I survived that and a million other childhood experiences. I
grew up and I got along. I learned to fit in. I observed, recorded,
derived the algorithms and mimicked appropriate behaviors. Not
much of it was—heartfelt, I guess the word is. I had friends and enemies, like everyone else. I chose them by running through
checklists of behaviors and circumstances compiled from years of
observation.
* I may have grown up distant but I grew up objective, and I have
Robert Paglino to thank for that. His seminal observation set
everything in motion. It led me into Synthesis, fated me to our
disastrous encounter with the Scramblers, spared me the worse fate
befalling Earth. Or the better one, I suppose, depending on your
point of view. Point of view matters: I see that now, blind, talking
to myself, trapped in a coffin falling past the edge of the solar
system. I see it for the first time since some beaten bloody friend
on a childhood battlefield convinced me to throw my own point of
view away.
He may have been wrong. I may have been. But that, that
distance—that chronic sense of being an alien among your own
kind—it's not entirely a bad thing.
It came in especially handy when the real aliens came calling.
