In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life
was in balance.
And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make,
and they did flood the market.
And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea,
few of them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could
make up the shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.
And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy,
and Sperm must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally."
And it was so.
And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape.
It may breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my
one commandment unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy
genes."
And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if
sowed abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then
abandon them when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."
But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is
but half mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's
bodies were warm of blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote
myself to those, and protect them at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into
this. And though he doth struggle at my side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my
competitors."
And Sperm liked this not.
And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto
the day they made themselves obsolete.
I brought her flowers one dusky Tuesday evening when the light was perfect. I pointed out the irony of
that romantic old tradition— the severed genitalia of another species, offered as a precopulatory bribe
—and then I recited my story just as we were about to fuck.
To this day, I still don't know what went wrong. (Watts 72)
