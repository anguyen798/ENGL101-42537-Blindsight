If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it,
we would be so simple that we couldn't."
—Emerson M. Pugh
Sarasti, you bloodsucker.
My knees pressed against my forehead. I hugged my folded legs as though clinging to a branch over a
chasm.
You vicious asshole. You foul sadistic monster.
My breath rasped loud and mechanical. It nearly drowned out the blood roaring in my ears.
You tore me apart, you made me piss and shit myself and I cried like some gutted baby and you
stripped me naked, you fucking thing, you night crawler, you broke my tools, you took away anything I
ever had that let me touch anyone and you didn't have to you babyfucker, it wasn't necessary but you
knew that didn't you? You just wanted to play. I've seen your kind at it before, cats toying with mice,
catch and release, a taste of freedom and then pouncing again, biting, not hard enough to kill— not
just yet—before you let them loose again and they're hobbling now, maybe a leg snapped or a gash in
the belly but they're still trying, still running or crawling or dragging themselves as fast as they can
until you're on them again, and again because it's fun, because it gives you pleasure you sadistic piece
of shit. You send us into the arms of that hellish thing and it plays with us too, and maybe you're even
working together because it let me escape just like you do, it let me run right back into your arms and ^Page-304

[[Chapter-21#^Page-305]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-305
then you strip me down to some raw half-brained defenseless animal, I can't rotate or transform I can't
even talk and you—
You—
It wasn't even personal, was it? You don't even hate me. You were just sick of keeping it all in, sick of
restraining yourself with all this meat, and nobody else could be spared from their jobs. This was my
job, wasn't it? Not synthesist, not conduit. Not even cannon fodder or decoy duty. I'm just something
disposable to sharpen your claws on.
I hurt so much. It hurt just to breathe.
I was so alone.
Webbing pressed against the curve of my back, bounced me forward gently as a breeze, caught me
again. I was back in my tent. My right hand itched. I tried to flex the fingers, but they were embedded
in amber. Left hand reached for right, and found a plastic carapace extending to the elbow.
I opened my eyes. Darkness. Meaningless numbers and a red LED twinkled from somewhere along my
forearm.
I didn't remember coming here. I didn't remember anyone fixing me.
Breaking. Being broken. That's what I remembered. I wanted to die. I wanted to just stay curled up
until I withered away.
After an age, I forced myself to uncoil. I steadied myself, let some miniscule inertia bump me against
the taut insulated fabric of my tent. I waited for my breathing to steady. It seemed to take hours.
I called ConSensus to the wall, and a feed from the drum. Soft voices, harsh light flaring against the
wall: hurting my eyes, peeling them raw. I killed visual, and listened to words in the darkness.
"—a phase?" someone asked.
Susan James, her personhood restored. I knew her again: not a meat sack, no longer a thing.
"We have been over this." That was Cunningham. I knew him too. I knew them all. Whatever Sarasti
had done to me, however far he'd yanked me from my room, I'd somehow fallen back inside. ^Page-305

[[Chapter-21#^Page-306]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-306
It should have mattered more.
"—because for one thing, if it were really so pernicious, natural selection would have weeded it out,"
James was saying.
"You have a naïve understanding of evolutionary processes. There's no such thing as survival of the
fittest. Survival of the most adequate, maybe. It doesn't matter whether a solution's optimal. All that
matters is whether it beats the alternatives."
I knew that voice too. It belonged to a demon.
"Well, we damn well beat the alternatives." Some subtle overdubbed harmonic in James' voice
suggested a chorus: the whole Gang, rising as one in opposition.
I couldn't believe it. I'd just been mutilated, beaten before their eyes—and they were talking about
biology?
Maybe she's afraid to talk about anything else, I thought. Maybe she's afraid she might be next.
Or maybe she just couldn't care less what happens to me.
"It's true," Sarasti told her, "that your intellect makes up for your self-awareness to some extent. But
you're flightless birds on a remote island. You're not so much successful as isolated from any real
competition."
No more clipped speech patterns. No more terse phrasing. The transient had made his kill, found his
release. Now he didn't care who knew he was around.
"You?" Michelle whispered. "Not we?"
"We stop racing long ago," the demon said at last. "It's not our fault you don't leave it at that."
"Ah." Cunningham again. "Welcome back. Did you look in on Ke—"
"No." Bates said.
"Satisfied?" the demon asked.
"If you mean the grunts, I'm satisfied you're out of them," Bates said. "If you mean— it was
completely unwarranted, Jukka."
"It isn't." ^Page-306

[[Chapter-21#^Page-307]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-307
"You assaulted a crewmember. If we had a brig you'd be in it for the rest of the trip."
"This isn't a military vessel, Major. You're not in charge."
I didn't need a visual feed to know what Bates thought of that. But there was something else in her
silence, something that made me bring the drum camera back online. I squinted against the corrosive
light, brought down the brightness until all that remained was a faint whisper of pastels.
Yes. Bates. Stepping off the stairway onto the deck
"Grab a chair," Cunningham said from his seat in the Commons. "It's golden oldies time."
There was something about her.
"I'm sick of that song," Bates said. "We've played it to death."
Even now, my tools chipped and battered, my perceptions barely more than baseline, I could see the
change. This torture of prisoners, this assault upon crew, had crossed a line in her head. The others
wouldn't see it. The lid on her affect was tight as a boilerplate. But even through the dim shadows of
my window the topology glowed around her like neon.
Amanda Bates was no longer merely considering a change of command. Now it was only a matter of
when.
*
The universe was closed and concentric.
My tiny refuge lay in its center. Outside that shell was another, ruled by a monster, patrolled by his
lackeys. Beyond that was another still, containing something even more monstrous and
incomprehensible, something that might soon devour us all.
There was nothing else. Earth was a vague hypothesis, irrelevant to this pocket cosmos. I saw no place
into which it might fit.
I stayed in the center of the universe for a long time, hiding. I kept the lights off. I didn't eat. I crept
from my tent only to piss or shit in the cramped head down at Fab, and only when the spine ^Page-307

[[Chapter-21#^Page-308]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-308
was
deserted. A field of painful blisters rose across my flash-burned back, as densely packed as kernels on
a corncob. The slightest abrasion tore them open.
Nobody tapped at my door, nobody called my name through ConSensus. I wouldn't have answered if
they had. Maybe they knew that, somehow. Maybe they kept their distance out of respect for my
privacy and my disgrace.
Maybe they just didn't give a shit.
I peeked outside now and then, kept an eye on Tactical. I saw Scylla and Charybdis climb into the
accretion belt and return towing captured reaction mass in a great distended mesh between them. I
watched our ampsat reach its destination in the middle of nowhere, saw antimatter's quantum
blueprints stream down into Theseus's buffers. Mass and specs combined in Fab, topped up our
reserves, forged the tools that Jukka Sarasti needed for his master plan, whatever that was.
Maybe he'd lose. Maybe Rorschach would kill us all, but not before it had played with Sarasti the way
Sarasti had played with me. That would almost make it worthwhile. Or maybe Bates' mutiny would
come first, and succeed. Maybe she would slay the monster, and commandeer the ship, and take us all
to safety.
But then I remembered: the universe was closed, and so very small. There was really nowhere else to
go.
I put my ear to feeds throughout the ship. I heard routine instructions from the predator, murmured
conversations among the prey. I took in only sound, never sight; a video feed would have spilled light
into my tent, left me naked and exposed. So I listened in the darkness as the others spoke among
themselves. It didn't happen often any more. Perhaps too much had been said already, perhaps there
was nothing left to do but mind the countdown. Sometimes hours would pass with no more than a
cough or a grunt.
When they did speak, they never mentioned my name. Only once did I hear any of them even hint at
my existence. ^Page-308

[[Chapter-21#^Page-309]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-309
That was Cunningham, talking to Sascha about zombies. I heard them in the galley over breakfast,
unusually talkative. Sascha hadn't been let out for a while, and was making up for lost time.
Cunningham let her, for reasons of his own. Maybe his fears had been soothed somehow, maybe
Sarasti had revealed his master plan. Or maybe Cunningham simply craved distraction from the
imminence of the enemy.
"It doesn't bug you?" Sascha was saying. "Thinking that your mind, the very thing that makes you you,
is nothing but some kind of parasite?"
"Forget about minds," he told her. "Say you've got a device designed to monitor—oh, cosmic rays, say.
What happens when you turn its sensor around so it's not pointing at the sky anymore, but at its own
guts?" He answered himself before she could: "It does what it's built to. It measures cosmic rays, even
though it's not looking at them any more. It parses its own circuitry in terms of cosmic-ray metaphors,
because those feel right, because they feel natural, because it can't look at things any other way. But
it's the wrong metaphor. So the system misunderstands everything about itself. Maybe that's not a
grand and glorious evolutionary leap after all. Maybe it's just a design flaw."
"But you're the biologist. You know Mom was right better'n anyone. Brain's a big glucose hog.
Everything it does costs through the nose."
"True enough," Cunningham admitted.
"So sentience has gotta be good for something, then. Because it's expensive, and if it sucks up energy
without doing anything useful then evolution's gonna weed it out just like that."
"Maybe it did." He paused long enough to chew food or suck smoke. "Chimpanzees are smarter than
Orangutans, did you know that? Higher encephalisation quotient. Yet they can't always recognize
themselves in a mirror. Orangs can."
"So what's your point? Smarter animal, less self-awareness? Chimpanzees are becoming nonsentient?" ^Page-309

[[Chapter-21#^Page-310]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-310
"Or they were, before we stopped everything in its tracks."
"So why didn't that happen to us?"
"What makes you think it didn't?"
It was such an obviously stupid question that Sascha didn't have an answer for it. I could imagine her
gaping in the silence.
"You're not thinking this through," Cunningham said. "We're not talking about some kind of zombie
lurching around with its arms stretched out, spouting mathematical theorems. A smart automaton
would blend in. It would observe those around it, mimic their behavior, act just like everyone else. All
the while completely unaware of what it was doing. Unaware even of its own existence."
"Why would it bother? What would motivate it?"
"As long as you pull your hand away from an open flame, who cares whether you do it because it hurts
or because some feedback algorithm says withdraw if heat flux exceeds critical T? Natural selection
doesn't care about motives. If impersonating something increases fitness, then nature will select good
impersonators over bad ones. Keep it up long enough and no conscious being would be able to pick
your zombie out of a crowd." Another silence; I could hear him chewing through it. "It'll even be able
to participate in a conversation like this one. It could write letters home, impersonate real human
feelings, without having the slightest awareness of its own existence."
"I dunno, Rob. It just seems—"
"Oh, it might not be perfect. It might be a bit redundant, or resort to the occasional expository
infodump. But even real people do that, don't they?"
"And eventually, there aren't any real people left. Just robots pretending to give a shit."
"Perhaps. Depends on the population dynamics, among other things. But I'd guess that at least one
thing an automaton lacks is empathy; if you can't feel, you can't really relate to something that does,
even if you act as though you do. Which makes it interesting ^Page-310

[[Chapter-21#^Page-311]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-311
to note how many sociopaths show up in
the world's upper echelons, hmm? How ruthlessness and bottom-line self-interest are so lauded up in
the stratosphere, while anyone showing those traits at ground level gets carted off into detention with
the Realists. Almost as if society itself is being reshaped from the inside out."
"Oh, come on. Society was always pretty— wait, you're saying the world's corporate elite are
nonsentient?"
"God, no. Not nearly. Maybe they're just starting down that road. Like chimpanzees."
"Yeah, but sociopaths don't blend in well."
"Maybe the ones that get diagnosed don't, but by definition they're the bottom of the class. The others
are too smart to get caught, and real automatons would do even better. Besides, when you get
powerful enough, you don't need to act like other people. Other people start acting like you."
Sascha whistled. "Wow. Perfect play-actor."
"Or not so perfect. Sound like anyone we know?"
They may have been talking about someone else entirely, I suppose. But that was as close to a direct
reference to Siri Keeton that I heard in all my hours on the grapevine. Nobody else mentioned me,
even in passing. That was statistically unlikely, given what I'd just endured in front of them all;
someone should have said something. Perhaps Sarasti had ordered them not to discuss it. I didn't know
why. But it was obvious by now that the vampire had been orchestrating their interactions with me for
some time. Now I was in hiding, but he knew I'd listen in at some point. Maybe, for some reason, he
didn't want my surveillance—contaminated...
He could have simply locked me out of ConSensus. He hadn't. Which meant he still wanted me in the
loop.
Zombies. Automatons. Fucking sentience.
For once in your goddamned life, understand something.
He'd said that to me. Or something had. During the assault.
Understand that your life depends on it. ^Page-311

[[Chapter-21#^Page-312]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-312
Almost as if he were doing me a favor.
Then he'd left me alone. And had evidently told the others to do the same.
Are you listening, Keeton?
And he hadn't locked me out of ConSensus.
Centuries of navel-gazing. Millennia of masturbation. Plato to Descartes to Dawkins to Rhanda. Souls
and zombie agents and qualia. Kolmogorov complexity. Consciousness as Divine Spark.
Consciousness as electromagnetic field. Consciousness as functional cluster.
I explored it all.
Wegner thought it was an executive summary. Penrose heard it in the singing of caged electrons.
Nirretranders said it was a fraud; Kazim called it leakage from a parallel universe. Metzinger wouldn't
even admit it existed. The AIs claimed to have worked it out, then announced they couldn't explain it
to us. Gödel was right after all: no system can fully understand itself.
Not even the synthesists had been able to rotate it down. The load-bearing beams just couldn't take the
strain.
All of them, I began to realize, had missed the point. All those theories, all those drugdreams and
experiments and models trying to prove what consciousness was: none to explain what it was good for.
None needed: obviously, consciousness makes us what we are. It lets us see the beauty and the
ugliness. It elevates us into the exalted realm of the spiritual. Oh, a few outsiders—Dawkins, Keogh,
the occasional writer of hackwork fiction who barely achieved obscurity—wondered briefly at the why
of it: why not soft computers, and no more? Why should nonsentient systems be inherently inferior?
But they never really raised their voices above the crowd. The value of what we are was too trivially
self-evident to ever call into serious question. ^Page-312

[[Chapter-21#^Page-313]] ~Chapter-21 ~Page-313
Yet the questions persisted, in the minds of the laureates, in the angst of every horny fifteen-year-old
on the planet. Am I nothing but sparking chemistry? Am I a magnet in the ether? I am more than my
eyes, my ears, my tongue; I am the little thing behind those things, the thing looking out from inside.
But who looks out from its eyes? What does it reduce to? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
What a stupid fucking question. I could have answered it in a second, if Sarasti hadn't forced me to
understand it first. ^Page-313
