"You have eyes, but you do not see"
—Jesus the Nazorean
I don't know how to feel about this, I thought. He was a good man. He was decent, he was kind to me,
even when he didn't know I was listening in. I didn't know him long— he wasn't a friend exactly— but
still. I should miss him. I should mourn.
I should feel more than this sick sinking fear that I could be next...
Sarasti hadn't wasted any time. Szpindel's replacement met us as we emerged, freshly thawed,
nicotine-scented. The rehydration of his flesh was ongoing— saline bladders clung to each thigh—
although it would never entirely erase the sharpness of his features. His bones cracked when he
moved.
He looked past me and took the body. "Susan—Michelle...I—"
The gang turned away.
He coughed, began fumbling a body condom over the corpse. "Sarasti wants everyone in the drum."
"We're hot," Bates said. Even cut short, the excursion had piled up a lethal Seivert count. Faint nausea
tickled the back of my throat.
"Decontaminate later." One long pull of a zipper and Szpindel was gone, engulfed in an oily gray
shroud. "You—" he turned in my direction, pointed at the scorched holes in my jumpsuit. "With me."
Robert Cunningham. Another prototype. Dark-haired, hollow ^Page-198

[[Chapter-13#^Page-199]] 
-cheeked, a jaw you could use as a ruler.
Both smoother and harsher than the man he had replaced. Where Szpindel had ticced and jerked as if
static-charged, Cunningham's face held all the expression of a wax dummy's. The wetware that ran
those muscles had been press-ganged into other pursuits. Even the tremors that afflicted the rest of his
body were muted, soothed by the nicotine he drew with every second breath.
He held no cigarette now. He held only the shrouded body of his hard-luck primary and his ongoing,
freshly thawed distaste for the ship's synthesist. His fingers trembled.
Bates and the Gang moved silently up the spine. Cunningham and I followed, guiding the Shroud of
Szpindel between us. My leg and side were stinging again, now that Cunningham had reminded them
to. There wouldn't be much he could do about them, though. The beams would have cauterized the
flesh on their way through, and if they'd hit anything vital I'd have been dead already.
At the hatch we broke into single-file: Szpindel first, Cunningham pushing at his heels. By the time I
emerged into the drum Bates and the gang were already down on deck and taking their usual seats.
Sarasti, in the flesh, watched them from the end of the conference table.
His eyes were naked. From this angle the soft, full-spectrum light of the drum washed the shine from
them. If you didn't look too closely, for too long, you might almost think those eyes were Human.
BioMed had been spun down for my arrival. Cunningham pointed to a diagnostic couch on a section of
the stilled deck that served as our infirmary; I floated over and strapped myself in. Two meters away,
past a waist-high guard rail that had risen from the deck, the rest of the drum rolled smoothly past. It
slung Bates and the Gang and Sarasti around like weights on a string.
I tapped ConSensus to hear them. James was speaking, quietly and without expression. "I noticed a
new pattern in the form-constants. ^Page-199

[[Chapter-13#^Page-200]] 
Something in the grating. It looked like a signal. It got stronger as I
went down the tunnel, I followed it, I blacked out. I don't remember anything more until we were on
our way back. Michelle filled me in, as much as she could. That's all I know. I'm sorry."
A hundred degrees away in the no-gee zone, Cunningham maneuvered his predecessor into a coffin
with different options than those up front. I wondered if it would embark on an autopsy during the
debriefing. I wondered if we'd be able to hear the sounds it made.
"Sascha," Sarasti said.
"Yeah." Sascha's trademark drawl infected the voice. "I was riding Mom. Went deaf dumb and stark
fucking blind when she passed out. I tried to take over but something was blocking me. Michelle, I
guess. Never thought she had it in her. I couldn't even see."
"But you don't lose consciousness."
"I was awake the whole time, far as I know. Just completely in the dark."
"Smell? Tactile?"
"I could feel it when Michelle pissed in the suit. But I didn't notice anything else."
Cunningham was back at my side. The inevitable cigarette had appeared between his lips.
"Nothing touches you," the vampire surmised. "Nothing grabs your leg."
"No," Sascha said. She didn't believe Michelle's stories about invisible monsters. None of us did; why
bother, when dementia could so easily explain anything we experienced?
"Cruncher."
"Don't know anything," I still wasn't used to the maleness of the voice now emanating from James's
throat. Cruncher was a workaholic. He hardly ever surfaced in mixed company.
"You're there," Sarasti reminded him. "You must remember some—"
"Mom sent me patterns to parse. I was working on them. I'm still ^Page-200

[[Chapter-13#^Page-201]] 
working on them," he added
pointedly. "I didn't notice anything. Is that all?"
I'd never been able to get a good read on him. Sometimes Cruncher seemed to have more in common
with the dozens of nonconscious modules working in James's head than with sentient hubs comprising
the rest of the Gang. "You feel nothing?" Sarasti pressed.
"Just the patterns."
"Anything significant?"
"Standard phenomath spirals and gratings. But I haven't finished. Can I go now?"
"Yes. Call Michelle, please."
Cunningham stabbed at my wounds with anabolisers, muttering to himself. Faint blue smoke curled
between us. "Isaac found some tumors," he observed.
I nodded and coughed. My throat was sore. The nausea had grown heavy enough to sink below my
diaphragm.
"Michelle." Sarasti repeated.
"I see some more here," Cunningham continued. "Along the bottom of your brain pan. Only a few
dozen cells so far, they're not worth burning yet."
"Here." Michelle's voice was barely audible, even through ConSensus, but at least it was the voice of
an adult. "I'm here."
"What do you remember, please?"
"I—I felt—I was just riding Mom, and then she was gone and there was no one else, so I had to—take
over..."
"Do you see the septum close?"
"Not really. I felt it going dark, but when I turned around we were already trapped. And then I felt
something behind me, it wasn't loud or harsh it just sort of bumped, and it grabbed me, and—and—
"I'm sorry," she said after a moment. "I'm a bit—woozy..."
Sarasti waited. ^Page-201

[[Chapter-13#^Page-202]] 
"Isaac," Michelle whispered. "He..."
"Yes." A pause. "We're very sorry about that."
"Maybe—can he be fixed?"
"No. There's brain damage." There was something like sympathy in the vampire's voice, the practiced
affectation of an accomplished mimic. There was something else, too, an all-but-imperceptible
hunger, a subtle edge of temptation. I don't think anyone heard it but me.
We were sick, and getting sicker. Predators are drawn to the weak and injured.
Michelle had fallen silent again. When she continued, her voice only faltered a little: "I can't tell you
much. It grabbed me. It let me go. I went to pieces, and I can't explain why except that fucking place
just does things to you, and I was—weak. I'm sorry. There's not much else to tell you."
"Thank you," Sarasti said after a long moment.
"Can I—I'd like to leave if that's okay."
"Yes," Sarasti said. Michelle sank below the surface as the Commons rotated past. I didn't see who
took her place.
"The grunts didn't see anything," Bates remarked. "By the time we broke through the septum the
tunnel behind was empty."
"Any bogey would have had plenty of time to hightail," Cunningham said. He planted his feet on the
deck and grabbed a handhold; the subdrum began to move. I drifted obliquely against my restraints.
"I don't disagree," Bates said, "But if there's anything we've learned about that place, it's that we can't
trust our senses."
"Trust Michelle's," Sarasti said. He opened a window as I grew heavier: a grunt's-eye view of a fuzzy,
bright blob weaving behind the translucent waxed-paper fibers of the skinned septum. James's
headlight, from the wrong side of the barrier. The image wobbled a bit as the drone staggered through
some local pocket of magnetism, then replayed. Wobbled, replayed. A six-second loop. ^Page-202

[[Chapter-13#^Page-203]] 
"See something next to the Gang."
Non-vampires saw no such thing. Sarasti froze the image, evidently realizing as much. "Diffraction
patterns aren't consistent with a single light source in open space. I see dimmer elements, reflective
elements. Two dark objects close together, similar size, scattering light here—" a cursor appeared at
two utterly nondescript points on the image— "and here. One's the Gang. The other's unaccounted
for."
"Just a minute," Cunningham said. "If you can see it through all that, why didn't Su—why didn't
Michelle see anything?"
"Synesthesiac," Sarasti reminded him. "You see. She feels."
BioMed jerked slightly, locking into spin-synch with the drum; the guard rail sank back into the deck.
Off in some far-off corner, something without eyes watched me watching it.
"Shit," Bates whispered. "There's someone home."
They never really talked like that, by the way. You'd hear gibberish—a half-dozen languages, a whole
Babel of personal idioms—if I spoke in their real voices.
Some of the simpler tics make it through: Sascha's good-natured belligerence, Sarasti's aversion to the
past tense. Cunningham lost most of his gender pronouns to an unforeseen glitch during the work on
his temporal lobe. But it went beyond that. The whole lot of them threw English and Hindi and
Hadzane into every second sentence; no real scientist would allow their thoughts to be hamstrung by
the conceptual limitations of a single language. Other times they acted almost as synthesists in their
own right, conversing in grunts and gestures that would be meaningless to any baseline. It's not so
much that the bleeding edge lacks social skills; it's just that once you get past a certain point, formal
speech is too damn slow.
Except for Susan James. The walking contradiction, the woman so devoted to Communication As
Unifier that she'd cut her own brain ^Page-203

[[Chapter-13#^Page-204]] 
into disunified chunks to make the point. She was the only one
who ever seemed to care who she was talking to. The others spoke only for themselves, even when
they spoke to each other. Even James's other cores would speak their own minds in their own way, and
let everyone else translate as best they could. It wasn't a problem. Everyone on Theseus could read
everyone else.
But that didn't matter to Susan James. She fit each of her words to their intended recipient, she
accommodated.
I am a conduit. I exist to bridge the gap, and I'd bridge nothing if I only told you what these people
said. So I am telling you what they meant, and it will mean as much to you as you can handle.
Except for Susan James, linguist and Ringleader, whom I trust to speak for herself.
Fifteen minutes to apogee: maximum safe distance, in case Rorschach decided to hit back. Far below,
the artefact's magnetic field pressed into Ben's atmosphere like God's little finger. Great dark
thunderheads converged behind it; turbulent moon-sized curlicues collided in its wake.
Fifteen minutes to apogee, and Bates was still hoping Sarasti would change his mind.
In a way, this was her fault. If she had just treated this new travail as one more cross to bear, perhaps
things would have gone on more or less as before. There would have been some faint hope that Sarasti
would have let us grit our teeth and keep on going, besieged now by spring-loaded trapdoors as well as
the usual gauntlet of Seiverts and magnets and monsters from the id. But Bates had made an issue out
of it. It wasn't just another piece of shit in the sewer to her: it was the one that clogged the pipe.
We're on the brink as it is, just surviving the baseline environment of this thing. If it's started taking
deliberate countermeasures...I don't see how we can risk it. ^Page-204

[[Chapter-13#^Page-205]] 
Fourteen minutes to apogee, and Amanda Bates was still regretting those words.
On previous expeditions we'd charted twenty-six septa in various stages of development. We'd x-rayed
them. We'd done ultrasound. We'd watched them ooze their way across passages or ebb slowly back
into the walls. The iris that had snapped shut behind the Gang of Four had been a whole different
animal.
And what are the odds that the first one with a hair-trigger just happened to also come with antilaser
prismatics? That was no routine growth event. That thing was set for us.
Set by...
That was the other thing. Thirteen minutes to apogee, and Bates was worried about the tenants.
It had always been breaking and entering, of course. That much hadn't changed. But when we'd
jimmied the lock we'd thought we were vandalizing an empty summer cottage, still under
construction. We'd thought the owners would be out of the picture for a while. We hadn't been
expecting one of them to catch us on his way to take a late-night piss. And now that one had, and
vanished into the labyrinth, it was natural to wonder what weapons it might keep stashed under the
pillow...
Those septa could spring on us any time. How many are there? Are they fixed, or portable? We can't
proceed without knowing these things..
At first, Bates had been surprised and delighted when Sarasti agreed with her.
Twelve minutes to apogee. From this high ground, well above the static, Theseus peered down through
Rorschach's wrenched and twisted anatomy to keep rock-steady eyes on the tiny wound we'd burned in
its side. Our limpet tent covered it like a blister; inside, Jack fed us a second, first-person view of the
unfolding experiment.
Sir. We know Rorschach is inhabited. Do we want to risk further provoking the inhabitants? Do we
want to risk killing them? ^Page-205

[[Chapter-13#^Page-206]] 
Sarasti hadn't quite looked at her, and hadn't quite spoken. If he had, he might have said I do not
understand how meat like you survived to adulthood.
Eleven minutes to apogee, and Amanda Bates was lamenting the fact—not for the first time— that
this mission was not under military jurisdiction.
We were waiting for maximum distance before performing the experiment. Rorschach might interpret
this as a hostile act, Sarasti had conceded in a voice that contained no trace of irony whatsoever. Now
he stood before us, watching ConSensus play on the table. Reflections writhed across his naked eyes,
not quite masking the deeper reflections behind them.
Ten minutes to apogee. Susan James was wishing that Cunningham would put out that goddamned
cigarrette. The smoke stank on its way to the ventilators, and anyway, it wasn't necessary. It was just
an anachronistic affectation, an attention-getting device; if he needed the nicotine a patch could have
soothed his tremors just as easily, without the smoke and the stink.
That wasn't all she was thinking, though. She was wondering why Cunningham had been summoned to
Sarasti's quarters earlier in the shift, why he'd looked at her so strangely afterward. I wondered about
that myself. A quick check on ConSensus timestamps showed that her medical file had been accessed
during that period. I checked those stats, let the shapes bounce between hemispheres: part of my brain
locked on elevated oxytocin as the probable reason for that conference. There was an eighty-two
percent chance that James had become too trusting for Sarasti's liking.
I had no idea how I knew that. I never did.
Nine minutes to apogee
Barely a molecule of Rorschach's atmosphere had been lost on our account. That was all about to
change. Our view of base camp split like a dividing bacterium: one window now focused on the limpet
tent, the other on a wide-angle tactical enhance of the space around it. ^Page-206

[[Chapter-13#^Page-207]] 
Eight minutes to apogee. Sarasti pulled the plug.
Down on Rorschach, our tent burst like a bug beneath a boot. A geyser erupted from the wound; a
snowstorm swirled at its edges, its charged curlicues intricate as lace. Atmosphere gushed into
vacuum, spread thin, crystallized. Briefly, the space around base camp sparkled. It was almost
beautiful.
Bates didn't think it was beautiful at all. She watched that bleeding wound with a face as
expressionless as Cunningham's, but her jaw was clenched unto tetanus. Her eyes darted between
views: watching for things gasping in the shadows.
Rorschach convulsed.
Vast trunks and arteries shuddered, a seismic tremor radiating out along the structure. The epicenter
began to twist, a vast segment rotating on its axis, the breach midway along its length. Stress lines
appeared where the length that rotated sheared against the lengths to either side that didn't; the
structure seemed to soften and stretch there, constricting like a great elongate balloon torqueing itself
into sausage links.
Sarasti clicked. Cats made something like that sound when they spied a bird on the far side of a
windowpane.
ConSensus groaned with the sound of worlds scraping against each other: telemetry from the onsite
sensors, their ears to the ground. Jack's camera controls had frozen again. The image it sent was
canted and grainy. The pickup stared blankly at the edge of the hole we'd bored into the underworld.
The groaning subsided. A final faint cloud of crystalline stardust dissipated into space, barely visible
even on max enhance.
No bodies. None visible, anyway.
Sudden motion at base camp. At first I thought it was static on Jack's feed, playing along lines of high
contrast—but no, something was definitely moving along the edges of the hole we'd burned.
Something almost wriggled there, a thousand gray mycelia extruding from the cut surface and
writhing slowly into the darkness. ^Page-207

[[Chapter-13#^Page-208]] 
"It's—huh," Bates said. "Triggered by the pressure drop, I guess.
That's one way to seal a breach."
Two weeks after we'd wounded it, Rorschach had begun to heal itself.
Apogee behind us now. All downhill from here. Theseus began the long drop back into enemy
territory.
"Doesn't use septa," Sarasti said. ^Page-208
