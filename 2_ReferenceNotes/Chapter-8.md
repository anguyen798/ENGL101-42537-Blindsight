"Life's too short for chess."
— Byron
They never sealed the hatch behind them. It was too easy to get lost up there in the dome, naked
infinite space stretching a hundred eighty degrees on every axis. They needed all that emptiness but
they needed an anchor in its midst: soft stray light from astern, a gentle draft from the drum, the
sounds of people and machinery close by. They needed to have it both ways.
I lay in wait. Reading a dozen blatant cues in their behavior, I was already squirreled away in the
forward airlock when they passed. I gave them a few minutes and crept forward to the darkened
bridge.
"Of course they called her by name," Szpindel was saying. "That was the only name they had. She told
them, remember?"
"Yes." Michelle didn't seem reassured.
"Hey, it was you guys said we were talking to a Chinese Room. You saying you were wrong?"
"We—no. Of course not."
"Then it wasn't really threatening Suze at all, was it? It wasn't threatening any of us. It had no idea
what it was saying."
"It's rule-based, Isaac. It was following some kind of flowchart it drew up by observing Human
languages in action. And somehow those rules told it to respond with threats of violence."
"But if it doesn't even know what it was saying—" ^Page-126

[[Chapter-8#^Page-127]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-127
"It doesn't. It can't. We parsed the phrasing nineteen different ways, tried out conceptual units of every
different length..." A long, deep breath. "But it attacked the probe, Isaac."
"Jack just got too close to one of those electrode thingies is all. It just arced."
"So you don't think Rorschach is hostile?"
Long silence—long enough to make me wonder if I'd been detected.
"Hostile," Szpindel said at last. "Friendly. We learned those words for life on Earth, eh? I don't know
if they even apply out here." His lips smacked faintly. "But I think it might be something like hostile."
Michelle sighed. "Isaac, there's no reason for—I mean, it just doesn't make sense that it would be. We
can't have anything it wants."
"It says it wants to be left alone," Szpindel said. "Even if it doesn't mean it."
They floated quietly for a while, up there past the bulkhead.
"At least the shielding held," Szpindel said finally. "That's something." He wasn't just talking about
Jack; our own carapace was coated with the same stuff now. It had depleted our substrate stockpiles by
two thirds, but no one wanted to rely on the ship's usual magnetics in the face of anything that could
play so easily with the electromagnetic spectrum.
"If they attack us, what do we do?" Michelle said.
"Learn what we can, while we can. Fight back. While we can."
"If we can. Look out there, Isaac. I don't care how embryonic that thing is. Tell me we're not
hopelessly outmatched."
"Outmatched, for sure. Hopelessly, never."
"That's not what you said before."
"Still. There's always a way to win."
"If I said that, you'd call it wishful thinking."
"If you said that, it would be. But I'm saying it, so it's game theory."
"Game theory again. Jesus, Isaac." ^Page-127

[[Chapter-8#^Page-128]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-128
"No, listen. You're thinking about the aliens like they were some kind of mammal. Something that
cares, something that looks after its investments."
"How do you know they aren't?"
"Because you can't protect your kids when they're lightyears away. They're on their own, and it's a big
cold dangerous universe so most of them aren't going to make it, eh? The most you can do is crank out
millions of kids, take cold comfort in knowing that a few always luck out through random chance. It's
not a mammal mind-set, Meesh. You want an earthbound simile, think of dandelion seeds. Or, or
herring."
A soft sigh. "So they're interstellar herring. That hardly means they can't crush us."
"But they don't know about us, not in advance. Dandelion seed doesn't know what it's up against before
it sprouts. Maybe nothing. Maybe some spastic weed that goes over like straw in the wind. Or maybe
something that kicks its ass halfway to the Magellanic Clouds. It doesn't know, and there's no such
thing as a one-size-fits-all survival strategy. Something that aces against one player blows goats
against a different one. So the best you can do is mix up your strategies based on the odds. It's a
weighted dice roll and it gives you the best mean payoff over the whole game, but you're bound to
crap out and choose the wrong strategy at least some of the time. Price of doing business. And that
means—that means—that weak players not only can win against stronger ones, but they're
statistically bound to in some cases."
Michelle snorted. "That's your game theory? Rock Paper Scissors with statistics?"
Maybe Szpindel didn't know the reference. He didn't speak, long enough to call up a subtitle; then he
brayed like a horse. "Rock Paper Scissors! Yes!"
Michelle digested that for a moment. "You're sweet for trying, but that only works if the other side is
just blindly playing the odds, ^Page-128

[[Chapter-8#^Page-129]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-129
and they don't have to do that if they know who they're going up against
in advance. And my dear, they have so very much information about us..."
They'd threatened Susan. By name.
"They don't know everything," Szpindel insisted. "And the principle works for any scenario involving
incomplete information, not just the ignorant extreme."
"Not as well."
"But some, and that gives us a chance. Doesn't matter how good you are at poker when it comes to the
deal, eh? Cards still deal out with the same odds."
"So that's what we're playing. Poker."
"Be thankful it's not chess. We wouldn't have a hope in hell."
"Hey. I'm supposed to be the optimist in this relationship."
"You are. I'm just fatalistically cheerful. We all come into the story halfway through, we all catch up
as best we can, and we're all gonna die before it ends."
"That's my Isaac. Master of the no-win scenario."
"You can win. Winner's the guy who makes the best guess on how it all comes out."
"So you are just guessing."
"Yup. And you can't make an informed guess without data, eh? And we could be the very first to find
out what's gonna happen to the whole Human race. I'd say that puts us into the semifinals, easy."
Michelle didn't answer for a very long time. When she did, I couldn't hear her words.
Neither could Szpindel: "Sorry?"
"Covert to invulnerable, you said. Remember?"
"Uh huh. Rorschach's Graduation Day. "
"How soon, do you think?"
"No idea. But I don't think it's the kind of thing that's gonna slip by unnoticed. And that's why I don't
think it attacked us."
She must have looked a question. ^Page-129

[[Chapter-8#^Page-130]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-130
"Because when it does, it won't be some debatable candy-ass bitch slap," he told her. "When that
fucker rises up, we're gonna know."
A sudden flicker from behind. I spun in the cramped passageway and bit down on a cry: something
squirmed out of sight around the corner, something with arms, barely glimpsed, gone in an instant.
Never there. Couldn't be there. Impossible.
"Did you hear that?" Szpindel asked, but I'd fled to stern before Michelle could answer him.
We'd fallen so far that the naked eye didn't see a disk, barely even saw curvature any more. We were
falling towards a wall, a vast roiling expanse of dark thunderclouds that extended in all directions to
some new, infinitely-distant horizon. Ben filled half the universe.
And still we fell.
Far below, Jack clung to Rorschach's ridged surface with bristly gecko-feet fenders and set up camp. It
sent x-rays and ultrasound into the ground, tapped enquiring fingers and listened to the echos, planted
tiny explosive charges and measured the resonance of their detonations. It shed seeds like pollen: tiny
probes and sensors by the thousands, self-powered, near-sighted, stupid and expendable. The vast
majority were sacrificial offerings to random chance; only one in a hundred lasted long enough to
return usable telemetry.
While our advance scout took measure of its local neighborhood, Theseus drew larger-scale birdseye
maps from the closing sky. It spat out thousands of its own disposable probes, spread them across the
heavens and collected stereoscopic data from a thousand simultaneous perspectives.
Patchwork insights assembled in the drum. Rorschach's skin was sixty percent superconducting carbon
nanotube. Rorschach's guts were largely hollow; at least some of those hollows appeared to contain an
atmosphere. No earthly form of life would have lasted a second in there, though; intricate
topographies of radiation and electromagnetic ^Page-130

[[Chapter-8#^Page-131]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-131
force seethed around the structure, seethed within it. In
some places the radiation was intense enough to turn unshielded flesh to ash in an instant; calmer
backwaters would merely kill in the same span of time. Charged particles raced around invisible
racetracks at relativistic speeds, erupting from jagged openings, hugging curves of magnetic force
strong enough for neutron stars, arcing through open space and plunging back into black mass.
Occasional protuberances swelled and burst and released clouds of microparticulates, seeding the
radiation belts like spores. Rorschach resembled nothing so much as a nest of half-naked cyclotrons,
tangled one with another.
Neither Jack below nor Theseus above could find any points of entry, beyond those impassable gaps
that spat out streams of charged particles or swallowed them back down. No airlocks or hatches or
viewports resolved with increasing proximity. The fact that we'd been threatened via laser beam
implied some kind of optical antennae or tightcast array; we weren't even able to find that much.
A central hallmark of von Neumann machines was self-replication. Whether Rorschach would meet
that criterion—whether it would germinate, or divide, or give birth when it passed some critical
threshold—whether it had done so already—remained an open question.
One of a thousand. At the end of it all—after all the measurements, the theorizing and deduction and
outright guesswork—we settled into orbit with a million trivial details and no answers. In terms of the
big questions, there was only one thing we knew for sure.
So far, Rorschach was holding its fire.
"It sounded to me like it knew what it was saying," I remarked.
"I guess that's the whole point," Bates said. She had no one to confide in, partook of no intimate
dialogs that could be overheard. With her, I used the direct approach. ^Page-131

[[Chapter-8#^Page-132]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-132
Theseus was birthing a litter, two by two. They were nasty-looking things, armored, squashed egg-
shapes, twice the size of a human torso and studded with gardening implements: antennae, optical
ports, retractable threadsaws. Weapons muzzles.
Bates was summoning her troops. We floated before the primary fab port at the base of Theseus' spine.
The plant could just as easily have disgorged the grunts directly into the hold beneath the carapace—
that was where they'd be stored anyway, until called upon—but Bates was giving each a visual
inspection before sending it through one of the airlocks a few meters up the passageway. Ritual,
perhaps. Military tradition. Certainly there was nothing she could see with her eyes that wouldn't be
glaringly obvious to the most basic diagnostic.
"Would it be a problem?" I asked. "Running them without your interface?"
"Run themselves just fine. Response time actually improves without spam in the network. I'm more of
a safety precaution."
Theseus growled, giving us more attitude. The plating trembled to stern; another piece of local debris,
no longer in our path. We were angling towards an equatorial orbit just a few miniscule kilometers
above the artefact; insanely, the approach curved right through the accretion belt.
It didn't bother the others. "Like surviving traffic in a high speed lane," Sascha had said, disdainful of
my misgivings. "Try creeping across and you're road kill. Gotta speed up, go with the flow." But the
flow was turbulent; we hadn't gone five minutes without a course correction since Rorschach had
stopped talking to us.
"So, do you buy it?" I asked. "Pattern-matching, empty threats? Nothing to worry about?"
"Nobody's fired on us yet," she said. Meaning: Not for a second.
"What's your take on Susan's argument? Different niches, no reason for conflict?"
"Makes sense, I guess." Utter bullshit. ^Page-132

[[Chapter-8#^Page-133]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-133
"Can you think of any reason why something with such different needs would attack us?"
"That depends," she said, "on whether the fact that we are different is reason enough."
I saw playground battlefields reflected in her topology. I remembered my own, and wondered if there
were any other kind.
Then again, that only proved the point. Humans didn't really fight over skin tone or ideology; those
were just handy cues for kin-selection purposes. Ultimately it always came down to bloodlines and
limited resources.
"I think Isaac would say this is different," I said.
"I guess." Bates sent one grunt humming off to the hold; two more emerged in formation, spinelight
glinting off their armor.
"How many of these are you making, anyway?"
"We're breaking and entering, Siri. Not wise to leave our own house unguarded."
I inspected her surfaces as she inspected theirs. Doubt and resentment simmered just beneath.
"You're in a tough spot," I remarked.
"We all are."
"But you're responsible for defending us, against something we don't know anything about. We're only
guessing that—"
"Sarasti doesn't guess," Bates said. "The man's in charge for a reason. Doesn't make much sense to
question his orders, given we're all about a hundred IQ points short of understanding the answer
anyway."
"And yet he's also got that whole predatory side nobody talks about," I remarked. "It must be difficult
for him, all that intellect coexisting with so much instinctive aggression. Making sure the right part
wins."
She wondered in that instant whether Sarasti might be listening in. She decided in the next that it
didn't matter: why should he care what the cattle thought, as long as they did what they were told? ^Page-133

[[Chapter-8#^Page-134]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-134
All she said was, "I thought you jargonauts weren't supposed to have opinions."
"That wasn't mine."
Bates paused. Returned to her inspection.
"You do know what I do," I said.
"Uh huh." The first of the current pair passed muster and hummed off up the spine. She turned to the
second. "You simplify things. So the folks back home can understand what the specialists are up to."
"That's part of it."
"I don't need a translator, Siri. I'm just a consultant, assuming things go well. A bodyguard if they
don't."
"You're an officer and a military expert. I'd say that makes you more than qualified when it comes to
assessing Rorschach's threat potential."
"I'm muscle. Shouldn't you be simplifying Jukka or Isaac?"
"That's exactly what I'm doing."
She looked at me.
"You interact," I said. "Every component of the system affects every other. Processing Sarasti without
factoring you in would be like trying to calculate acceleration while ignoring mass."
She turned back to her brood. Another robot passed muster.
She didn't hate me. What she hated was what my presence implied.
They don't trust us to speak for ourselves, she wouldn't say. No matter how qualified we are, no matter
how far ahead of the pack. Maybe even because of that. We're contaminated. We're subjective. So they
send Siri Keeton to tell them what we really mean.
"I get it," I said after a moment.
"Do you."
"It's not about trust, Major. It's about location. Nobody gets a good view of a system from the inside,
no matter who they are. The view's distorted."
"And yours isn't." ^Page-134

[[Chapter-8#^Page-135]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-135
"I'm outside the system."
"You're interacting with me now."
"As an observer only. Perfection's unattainable but it isn't unapproachable, you know? I don't play a
role in decision-making or research, I don't interfere in any aspect of the mission that I'm assigned to
study. But of course I ask questions. The more information I have, the better my analysis."
"I thought you didn't have to ask. I thought you guys could just, read the signs or something."
"Every bit helps. It all goes into the mix."
"You doing it now? Synthesizing?"
I nodded.
"And you do this without any specialized knowledge at all."
"I'm as much of a specialist as you. I specialize in processing informational topologies."
"Without understanding their content."
"Understanding the shapes is enough."
Bates seemed to find some small imperfection in the battlebot under scrutiny, scratched at its shell
with a fingernail. "Software couldn't do that without your help?"
"Software can do a lot of things. We've chosen to do some for ourselves." I nodded at the grunt. "Your
visual inspections, for example."
She smiled faintly, conceding the point.
"So I'd encourage you to speak freely. You know I'm sworn to confidentiality."
"Thanks," she said, meaning On this ship, there's no such thing.
Theseus chimed. Sarasti spoke in its wake: "Orbital insertion in fifteen minutes. Everyone to the drum
in five."
"Well," Bates said, sending one last grunt on its way. "Here we go." She pushed off and sailed up the
spine.
The newborn killing machines clicked at me. They smelled like new cars. ^Page-135

[[Chapter-8#^Page-136]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-136
"By the way," Bates called over her shoulder, "you missed the obvious one."
"Sorry?"
She spun a hundred-eighty degrees at the end of the passageway, landed like an acrobat beside the
drum hatch. "The reason. Why something would attack us even if we didn't have anything it wanted."
I read it off her: "If it wasn't attacking at all. If it was defending itself."
"You asked about Sarasti. Smart man. Strong Leader. Maybe could spend a little more time with the
troops."
Vampire doesn't respect his command. Doesn't listen to advice. Hides away half the time.
I remembered transient killer whales. "Maybe he's being considerate." He knows he makes us nervous.
"I'm sure that's it," Bates said.
Vampire doesn't trust himself.
It wasn't just Sarasti. They all hid from us, even when they had the upper hand. They always stayed
just the other side of myth.
It started pretty much the same way it did for anything else; vampires were far from the first to learn
the virtues of energy conservation. Shrews and hummingbirds, saddled with tiny bodies and
overclocked metabolic engines, would have starved to death overnight if not for the torpor that
overtook them at sundown. Comatose elephant seals lurked breathless at the bottom of the sea, rousing
only for passing prey or redline lactate levels. Bears and chipmunks cut costs by sleeping away the
impoverished winter months, and lungfish—Devonian black belts in the art of estivation—could curl
up and die for years, waiting for the rains.
With vampires it was a little different. It wasn't shortness of breath, or metabolic overdrive, or some
blanket of snow that locked the pantry every winter. The problem wasn't so much a lack of prey ^Page-136

[[Chapter-8#^Page-137]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-137
as a
lack of difference from it; vampires were such a recent split from the ancestral baseline that the
reproductive rates hadn't diverged. This was no woodland-variety lynx-hare dynamic, where prey
outnumbered predators a hundred to one. Vampires fed on things that bred barely faster than they did.
They would have wiped out their own food supply in no time if they hadn't learned how to ease off on
the throttle.
By the time they went extinct they'd learned to shut down for decades.
It made two kinds of sense. It not only slashed their metabolic needs while prey bred itself back to
harvestable levels, it gave us time to forget that we were prey. We were so smart by the Pleistocene,
smart enough for easy skepticism; if you haven't seen any night-stalking demons in all your years on
the savannah, why should you believe some senile campfire ramblings passed down by your mother's
mother?
It was murder on our ancestors, even if those same enemy genes—co-opted now—served us so well
when we left the sun a half-million years later. But it was almost—heartening, I guess—to think that
maybe Sarasti felt the tug of other genes, some aversion to prolonged visibility shaped by generations
of natural selection. Maybe he spent every moment in our company fighting voices that urged him to
hide, hide, let them forget. Maybe he retreated when they got too loud, maybe we made him as uneasy
as he made us.
We could always hope.
Our final orbit combined discretion and valor in equal measure.
Rorschach described a perfect equatorial circle 87,900 km from Big Ben's center of gravity. Sarasti
was unwilling to let it out of sight, and you didn't have to be a vampire to mistrust relay sats when
swinging through a radiation-soaked blizzard of rock and machinery. The obvious alternative was to
match orbits. ^Page-137

[[Chapter-8#^Page-138]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-138
At the same time, all the debate over whether or not Rorschach had meant—or even understood—the
threats it had made was a bit beside the point. Counterintrusion measures were a distinct possibility
either way, and ongoing proximity only increased the risk. So Sarasti had derived some optimum
compromise, a mildly eccentric orbit that nearly brushed the artefact at perigee but kept a discreet
distance the rest of the time. It was a longer trajectory than Rorschach's, and higher—we had to burn
on the descending arc to keep in synch—but the end result was continuously line-of-sight, and only
brought us within striking distance for three hours either side of bottoming out.
Our striking distance, that is. For all we knew Rorschach could have reached out and swatted us from
the sky before we'd even left the solar system.
Sarasti gave the command from his tent. ConSensus carried his voice into the drum as Theseus coasted
to apogee: "Now."
Jack had erected a tent about itself, a blister glued to Rorschach's hull and blown semi-taut against
vacuum with the merest whiff of nitrogen. Now it brought lasers to bear and started digging; if we'd
read the vibrations right, the ground should be only thirty-four centimeters deep beneath its feet. The
beams stuttered as they cut, despite six millimeters of doped shielding.
"Son of a bitch," Szpindel murmured. "It's working."
We burned through tough fibrous epidermis. We burned through veins of insulation that might have
been some sort of programmable asbestos. We burned through alternating layers of superconducting
mesh, and the strata of flaking carbon separating them.
We burned through.
The lasers shut down instantly. Within seconds Rorschach's intestinal gases had blown taut the skin of
the tent. Black carbon smoke swirled and danced in sudden thick atmosphere.
Nothing shot back at us. Nothing reacted. Partial pressures ^Page-138

[[Chapter-8#^Page-139]] ~Chapter-8 ~Page-139
piled up on ConSensus: methane,
ammonia, hydrogen. Lots of water vapor, freezing as fast as it registered.
Szpindel grunted. "Reducing atmosphere. Pre-Snowball." He sounded disappointed.
"Maybe it's a work in progress," James suggested. "Like the structure itself."
"Maybe."
Jack stuck out its tongue, a giant mechanical sperm with a myo-optical tail. Its head was a thick-
skinned lozenge, at least half ceramic shielding by cross-section; the tiny payload of sensors at its
core was rudimentary, but small enough for the whole assembly to thread through the pencil-thin hole
the laser had cut. It unspooled down the hole, rimming Rorschach's newly-torn orifice.
"Dark down there," James observed.
Bates: "But warm." 281K. Above freezing.
The endoscope emerged into darkness. Infrared served up a grainy grayscale of a — a tunnel, it looked
like, replete with mist and exotic rock formations. The walls curved like honeycomb, like the insides
of fossilized intestine. Cul-de-sacs and branches proliferated down the passage. The basic substrate
appeared to be a dense pastry of carbon-fiber leaves. Some of the gaps between those layers were
barely thick as fingernails; others looked wide enough to stack bodies.
"Ladies and gentlemen," Szpindel said softly, "The Devil's Baklava."
I could have sworn I saw something move. I could have sworn it looked familiar.
The camera died. ^Page-139
