"When it is dark enough, you can see the stars."
—Emerson
Where was I when the lights came down?
I was emerging from the gates of Heaven, mourning a father who was—to his own mind, at least—
still alive.
It had been scarcely two months since Helen had disappeared under the cowl. Two months by our
reckoning, at least. From her perspective it could have been a day or a decade; the Virtually
Omnipotent set their subjective clocks along with everything else.
She wasn't coming back. She would only deign to see her husband under conditions that amounted to a
slap in the face. He didn't complain. He visited as often as she would allow: twice a week, then once.
Then every two. Their marriage decayed with the exponential determinism of a radioactive isotope
and still he sought her out, and accepted her conditions.
On the day the lights came down, I had joined him at my mother's side. It was a special occasion, the
last time we would ever see her in the flesh. For two months her body had lain in state along with five
hundred other new ascendants on the ward, open for viewing by the next of kin. The interface was no
more real than it would ever be, of course; the body could not talk to us. But at least it was there, its
flesh warm, the sheets clean and straight. Helen's lower face was still visible below the cowl, though
eyes and ears ^Page-36

[[Chapter-3#^Page-37]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-37
were helmeted. We could touch her. My father often did. Perhaps some distant part of
her still felt it.
But eventually someone has to close the casket and dispose of the remains. Room must be made for
the new arrivals—and so we came to this last day at my mother's side. Jim took her hand one more
time. She would still be available in her world, on her terms, but later this day the body would be
packed into storage facilities crowded far too efficiently for flesh and blood visitors. We had been
assured that the body would remain intact—the muscles electrically exercised, the body flexed and
fed, the corpus kept ready to return to active duty should Heaven experience some inconceivable and
catastrophic meltdown. Everything was reversible, we were told. And yet—there were so many who
had ascended, and not even the deepest catacombs go on forever. There were rumors of
dismemberment, of nonessential body parts hewn away over time according to some optimum-
packing algorithm. Perhaps Helen would be a torso this time next year, a disembodied head the year
after. Perhaps her chassis would be stripped down to the brain before we'd even left the building,
awaiting only that final technological breakthrough that would herald the arrival of the Great Digital
Upload.
Rumors, as I say. I personally didn't know of anyone who'd come back after ascending, but then why
would anyone want to? Not even Lucifer left Heaven until he was pushed.
Dad might have known for sure—Dad knew more than most people, about the things most people
weren't supposed to know—but he never told tales out of turn. Whatever he knew, he'd obviously
decided its disclosure wouldn't have changed Helen's mind. That would have been enough for him.
We donned the hoods that served as day passes for the Unwired, and we met my mother in the spartan
visiting room she imagined for these visits. She'd built no windows into the world she occupied, no
hint of whatever utopian environment she'd constructed ^Page-37

[[Chapter-3#^Page-38]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-38
for herself. She hadn't even opted for one of
the prefab visiting environments designed to minimize dissonance among visitors. We found
ourselves in a featureless beige sphere five meters across. There was nothing in there but her.
Maybe not so far removed from her vision of utopia after all, I thought.
My father smiled. "Helen."
"Jim." She was twenty years younger than the thing on the bed, and still she made my skin crawl.
"Siri! You came!"
She always used my name. I don't think she ever called me son.
"You're still happy here?" my father asked.
"Wonderful. I do wish you could join us."
Jim smiled. "Someone has to keep the lights on."
"Now you know this isn't goodbye," she said. "You can visit whenever you like."
"Only if you do something about the scenery." Not just a joke, but a lie; Jim would have come at her
call even if the gauntlet involved bare feet and broken glass.
"And Chelsea, too," Helen continued. "It would be so nice to finally meet her after all this time."
"Chelsea's gone, Helen," I said.
"Oh yes but I know you stay in touch. I know she was special to you. Just because you're not together
any more doesn't mean she can't—"
"You know she—"
A startling possibility stopped me in mid-sentence: maybe I hadn't actually told them.
"Son," Jim said quietly. "Maybe you could give us a moment."
I would have given them a fucking lifetime. I unplugged myself back to the ward, looked from the
corpse on the bed to my blind and catatonic father in his couch, murmuring sweet nothings into the
datastream. Let them perform for each other. Let them formalize and finalize their so-called
relationship in whatever way they ^Page-38

[[Chapter-3#^Page-39]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-39
saw fit. Maybe, just once, they could even bring themselves to be
honest, there in that other world where everything else was a lie. Maybe.
I felt no desire to bear witness either way.
But of course I had to go back in for my own formalities. I adopted my role in the familial set-piece
one last time, partook of the usual lies. We all agreed that this wasn't going to change anything, and
nobody deviated enough from the script to call anyone else a liar on that account. And finally—careful
to say until next time rather than goodbye—we took our leave of my mother.
I even suppressed my gag reflex long enough to give her a hug.
*
Jim had his inhaler in hand as we emerged from the darkness. I hoped, without much hope, that he'd
throw it into the garbage receptacle as we passed through the lobby. But he raised it to his mouth and
took another hit of vassopressin, that he would never be tempted.
Fidelity in an aerosol. "You don't need that any more," I said.
"Probably not," he agreed.
"It won't work anyway. You can't imprint on someone who isn't even there, no matter how many
hormones you snort. It just—"
Jim said nothing. We passed beneath the muzzles of sentries panning for infiltrating Realists.
"She's gone," I blurted. "She doesn't care if you find someone else. She'd be happy if you did." It
would let her pretend the books had been balanced.
"She's my wife," he told me.
"That doesn't mean what it used to. It never did."
He smiled a bit at that. "It's my life, son. I'm comfortable with it."
"Dad—"
"I don't blame her," he said. "And neither should you."
Easy for him to say. Easy even to accept the hurt she'd inflicted ^Page-39

[[Chapter-3#^Page-40]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-40
on him all these years. This cheerful
façade here at the end hardly made up for the endless bitter complaints my father had endured
throughout living memory. Do you think it's easy when you disappear for months on end? Do you think
it's easy always wondering who you're with and what you're doing and if you're even alive? Do you
think it's easy raising a child like that on your own?
She'd blamed him for everything, but he bore it gracefully because he knew it was all a lie. He knew
he was only the pretense. She wasn't leaving because he was AWOL, or unfaithful. Her departure had
nothing to do with him at all. It was me. Helen had left the world because she couldn't stand to look at
the thing who'd replaced her son.
I would have pursued it—would have tried yet again to make my father see—but by now we'd left the
gates of Heaven for the streets of Purgatory, where pedestrians on all sides murmured in astonishment
and stared open-mouthed at the sky. I followed their gaze to a strip of raw twilight between the towers,
and gasped—
The stars were falling.
The Zodiac had rearranged itself into a precise grid of bright points with luminous tails. It was as
though the whole planet had been caught in some great closing net, the knots of its mesh aglow with
St. Elmo's fire. It was beautiful. It was terrifying.
I looked away to recalibrate my distance vision, to give this ill-behaved hallucination a chance to
vanish gracefully before I set my empirical gaze to high-beam. I saw a vampire in that moment, a
female, walking among us like the archetypal wolf in sheep's clothing. Vampires were uncommon
creatures at street level. I'd never seen one in the flesh before.
She had just stepped onto the street from the building across the way. She stood a head taller than the
rest of us, her eyes shining yellow and bright as a cat's in the deepening dark. She realized, as I
watched, that something was amiss. She looked around, glanced at the sky—and continued on her way,
totally indifferent to the ^Page-40

[[Chapter-3#^Page-41]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-41
cattle on all sides, to the heavenly portent that had transfixed them. Totally
indifferent to the fact that the world had just turned inside-out.
It was 1035 Greenwich Mean Time, February 13, 2082.
*
They clenched around the world like a fist, each black as the inside of an event horizon until those last
bright moments when they all burned together. They screamed as they died. Every radio up to geostat
groaned in unison, every infrared telescope went briefly snowblind. Ashes stained the sky for weeks
afterwards; mesospheric clouds, high above the jet stream, turned to glowing rust with every sunrise.
The objects, apparently, consisted largely of iron. Nobody ever knew what to make of that.
For perhaps the first time in history, the world knew before being told: if you'd seen the sky, you had
the scoop. The usual arbiters of newsworthiness, stripped of their accustomed role in filtering reality,
had to be content with merely labeling it. It took them ninety minutes to agree on Fireflies. A half
hour after that, the first Fourier transforms appeared in the noosphere; to no one's great surprise, the
Fireflies had not wasted their dying breaths on static. There was pattern embedded in that terminal
chorus, some cryptic intelligence that resisted all earthly analysis. The experts, rigorously empirical,
refused to speculate: they only admitted that the Fireflies had said something. They didn't know what.
Everyone else did. How else would you explain 65,536 probes evenly dispersed along a lat-long grid
that barely left any square meter of planetary surface unexposed? Obviously the Flies had taken our
picture. The whole world had been caught with its pants down in panoramic composite freeze-frame.
We'd been surveyed—whether as a prelude to formal introductions or outright invasion was anyone's
guess.
My father might have known someone who might have known. ^Page-41

[[Chapter-3#^Page-42]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-42
But by then he'd long since
disappeared, as he always did during times of hemispheric crisis. Whatever he knew or didn't, he left
me to find my own answers with everyone else.
There was no shortage of perspectives. The noosphere seethed with scenarios ranging from utopian to
apocalyptic. The Fireflies had seeded lethal germs through the jet stream. The Fireflies had been on a
nature safari. The Icarus Array was being retooled to power a doomsday weapon against the aliens.
The Icarus Array had already been destroyed. We had decades to react; anything from another solar
system would have to obey the lightspeed limit like everyone else. We had days to live; organic
warships had just crossed the asteroid belt and would be fumigating the planet within a week.
Like everyone else, I bore witness to lurid speculations and talking heads. I visited blathernodes,
soaked myself in other people's opinions. That was nothing new, as far as it went; I'd spent my whole
life as a sort of alien ethologist in my own right, watching the world behave, gleaning patterns and
protocols, learning the rules that allowed me to infiltrate human society. It had always worked before.
Somehow, though, the presence of real aliens had changed the dynamics of the equation. Mere
observation didn't satisfy any more. It was as though the presence of this new outgroup had forced me
back into the clade whether I liked it or not; the distance between myself and the world suddenly
seemed forced and faintly ridiculous.
Yet I couldn't, for my life, figure out how to let it go.
Chelsea had always said that telepresence emptied the Humanity from Human interaction. "They say
it's indistinguishable," she told me once, "just like having your family right there, snuggled up so you
can see them and feel them and smell them next to you. But it's not. It's just shadows on the cave wall.
I mean, sure, the shadows come in three-dee color with force-feedback tactile interactivity. They're
good enough to fool the civilized brain. But your gut knows ^Page-42

[[Chapter-3#^Page-43]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-43
those aren't people, even if it can't put its
finger on how it knows. They just don't feel real. Know what I mean?"
I didn't. Back then I'd had no clue what she was talking about. But now we were all cavemen again,
huddling beneath some overhang while lightning split the heavens and vast formless monsters, barely
glimpsed in bright strobe-frozen instants, roared and clashed in the darkness on all sides. There was no
comfort in solitude. You couldn't get it from interactive shadows. You needed someone real at your
side, someone to hold on to, someone to share your airspace along with your fear and hope and
uncertainty.
I imagined the presence of companions who wouldn't vanish the moment I unplugged. But Chelsea
was gone, and Pag in her wake. The few others I could have called— peers and former clients with
whom my impersonations of rapport had been especially convincing—didn't seem worth the effort.
Flesh and blood had its own relationship to reality: necessary, but not sufficient.
Watching the world from a distance, it occurred to me at last: I knew exactly what Chelsea had meant,
with her Luddite ramblings about desaturated Humanity and the colorless interactions of virtual space.
I'd known all along.
I'd just never been able to see how it was any different from real life.
*
Imagine you are a machine.
Yes, I know. But imagine you're a different kind of machine, one built from metal and plastic and
designed not by blind, haphazard natural selection but by engineers and astrophysicists with their eyes
fixed firmly on specific goals. Imagine that your purpose is not to replicate, or even to survive, but to
gather information.
I can imagine that easily. It is in fact a much simpler impersonation than the kind I'm usually called
on to perform. ^Page-43

[[Chapter-3#^Page-44]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-44
I coast through the abyss on the colder side of Neptune's orbit. Most of the time I exist only as an
absence, to any observer on the visible spectrum: a moving, asymmetrical silhouette blocking the
stars. But occasionally, during my slow endless spin, I glint with dim hints of reflected starlight. If
you catch me in those moments you might infer something of my true nature: a segmented creature
with foil skin, bristling with joints and dishes and spindly antennae. Here and there a whisper of
accumulated frost clings to a joint or seam, some frozen wisp of gas encountered in Jupiter space
perhaps. Elsewhere I carry the microscopic corpses of Earthly bacteria who thrived with carefree
abandon on the skins of space stations or the benign lunar surface—but who had gone to crystal at
only half my present distance from the sun. Now, a breath away from Absolute Zero, they might
shatter at a photon's touch.
My heart is warm, at least. A tiny nuclear fire burns in my thorax, leaves me indifferent to the cold
outside. It won't go out for a thousand years, barring some catastrophic accident; for a thousand years,
I will listen for faint voices from Mission Control and do everything they tell me to. So far they have
told me to study comets. Every instruction I have ever received has been a precise and unambiguous
elaboration on that one overriding reason for my existence.
Which is why these latest instructions are so puzzling, for they make no sense at all. The frequency is
wrong. The signal strength is wrong. I cannot even understand the handshaking protocols. I request
clarification.
The response arrives almost a thousand minutes later, and it is an unprecedented mix of orders and
requests for information. I answer as best I can: yes, this is the bearing at which signal strength was
greatest. No, it is not the usual bearing for Mission Control. Yes, I can retransmit: here it is, all over
again. Yes, I will go into standby mode. ^Page-44

[[Chapter-3#^Page-45]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-45
I await further instructions. They arrive 839 minutes later, and they tell me to stop studying comets
immediately.
I am to commence a controlled precessive tumble that sweeps my antennae through consecutive 5-
arc increments along all three axes, with a period of 94 seconds. Upon encountering any transmission
resembling the one which confused me, I am to fix upon the bearing of maximal signal strength and
derive a series of parameter values. I am also instructed to retransmit the signal to Mission Control.
I do as I'm told. For a long time I hear nothing, but I am infinitely patient and incapable of boredom.
Eventually a fleeting, familiar signal brushes against my afferent array. I reacquire and track it to
source, which I am well-equipped to describe: a trans-Neptunian comet in the Kuiper Belt,
approximately two hundred kilometers in diameter. It is sweeping a 21-cm tightbeam radio wave
across the heavens with a periodicity of 4.57 seconds. This beam does not intersect Mission Control's
coordinates at any point. It appears to be directed at a different target entirely.
It takes much longer than usual for Mission Control to respond to this information. When it does, it
tells me to change course. Mission Control informs me that henceforth my new destination is to be
referred to as Burns-Caulfield. Given current fuel and inertial constraints I will not reach it in less
than thirty-nine years.
I am to watch nothing else in the meantime.
*
I'd been liaising for a team at the Kurzweil Institute, a fractured group of cutting-edge savants
convinced they were on the verge of solving the quantum-glial paradox. That particular log-jam had
stalled AI for decades; once broken, the experts promised we'd be eighteen months away from the first
personality upload and only two years from reliable Human-consciousness emulation in a software
environment. It would spell the end of corporeal history, usher ^Page-45

[[Chapter-3#^Page-46]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-46
in a Singularity that had been waiting
impatiently in the wings for nigh on fifty years.
Two months after Firefall, the Institute cancelled my contract.
I was actually surprised it had taken them so long. It had cost us so much, this overnight inversion of
global priorities, these breakneck measures making up for lost initiative. Not even our shiny new post-
scarcity economy could withstand such a seismic shift without lurching towards bankruptcy.
Installations in deep space, long since imagined secure by virtue of their remoteness, were suddenly
vulnerable for exactly the same reason. Lagrange habitats had to be refitted for defense against an
unknown enemy. Commercial ships on the Martian Loop were conscripted, weaponised, and
reassigned; some secured the high ground over Mars while others fell sunward to guard the Icarus
Array.
It didn't matter that the Fireflies hadn't fired a shot at any of these targets. We simply couldn't afford
the risk.
We were all in it together, of course, desperate to regain some hypothetical upper hand by any means
necessary. Kings and corporations scribbled IOUs on the backs of napkins and promised to sort
everything out once the heat was off. In the meantime, the prospect of Utopia in two years took a back
seat to the shadow of Armageddon reaching back from next Tuesday. The Kurzweil Institute, like
everyone else, suddenly had other things to worry about.
So I returned to my apartment, split a bulb of Glenfiddich, and arrayed virtual windows like daisy
petals in my head. Everyone Icons debated on all sides, serving up leftovers two weeks past their
expiry date:
Disgraceful breakdown of global security.
No harm done.
Comsats annihilated. Thousands dead. ^Page-46

[[Chapter-3#^Page-47]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-47
Random collisions. Accidental
deaths.
(who sent them?)
We should have seen them coming. Why
didn't we—
Deep space. Inverse square. Do the
math.
They were stealthed!
(what do they want?)
We were raped!
Jesus Christ. They just took our
picture.
Why the silence?
Moon's fine. Mars's fine.
(Where are they?)
Why haven't they made contact?
Nothing's touched the O'Neills.
Technology Implies Belligerence!
(Are they coming
back?)
Nothing attacked us.
 Yet
Nothing invaded.
 So far.
(But where are
they?)
(Are they coming
back?)
(Anyone?)
Jim Moore Voice Only
encrypted
Accept?
The text window blossomed directly in my line of sight, eclipsing the debate. I read it twice. I tried to
remember the last time he'd called from the field, and couldn't. ^Page-47

[[Chapter-3#^Page-48]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-48
I muted the other windows. "Dad?"
"Son," he replied after a moment. "Are you well?"
"Like everyone else. Still wondering whether we should be celebrating or crapping our pants."
He didn't answer immediately. "It's a big question, all right," he said at last.
"I don't suppose you could give me any advice? They're not telling us anything at ground level."
It was a rhetorical request. His silence was hardly necessary to make the point. "I know," I added after
a moment. "Sorry. It's just, they're saying the Icarus Array went down, and—"
"You know I can't—oh." My father paused. "That's ridiculous. Icarus's fine."
"It is?"
He seemed to be weighing his words. "The Fireflies probably didn't even notice it. There's no particle
trail as long as it stays offstream, and it would be buried in solar glare unless someone knew where to
search."
It was my turn to fall silent. This conversation felt suddenly wrong.
Because when my father went on the job, he went dark. He never called his family.
Because even when my father came off the job, he never talked about it. It wouldn't matter whether the
Icarus Array was still online or whether it had been shredded and thrown into the sun like a thousand
kilometers of torn origami; he wouldn't tell either tale unless an official announcement had been
made. Which—I refreshed an index window just to be sure— it hadn't.
Because while my father was a man of few words, he was not a man of frequent, indecisive pauses—
and he had hesitated before each and every line he'd spoken in this exchange.
I tugged ever-so-gently on the line—"But they've sent ships."—and started counting. ^Page-48

[[Chapter-3#^Page-49]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-49
One one-thousand, two one-thousand—
"Just a precaution. Icarus was overdue for a visit anyway. You don't swap out your whole grid without
at least dropping in and kicking the new tires first."
Nearly three seconds to respond.
"You're on the moon," I said.
Pause. "Close enough."
"What are you—Dad, why are you telling me this? Isn't this a security breach?"
"You're going to get a call," he told me.
"From who? Why?"
"They're assembling a team. The kind of—people you deal with." My father was too rational to
dispute the contributions of the recons and hybrids in our midst, but he'd never been able to hide his
mistrust of them.
"They need a synthesist," he said.
"Isn't it lucky you've got one in the family."
Radio bounced back and forth. "This isn't nepotism, Siri. I wanted very much for them to pick
someone else."
"Thanks for the vote of conf—"
But he'd seen it coming, and preempted me before my words could cross the distance: "It's not a slap
at your abilities and you know it. You're simply the most qualified, and the work is vital."
"So why—" I began, and stopped. He wouldn't want to keep me away from some theoretical gig in a
WestHem lab.
"What's this about, Dad?"
"The Fireflies. They found something."
"What?"
"A radio signal. From the Kuiper. We traced the bearing."
"They're talking?"
"Not to us." He cleared his throat. "It was something of a fluke that we even intercepted the
transmission."
"Who are they talking to?" ^Page-49

[[Chapter-3#^Page-50]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-50
"We don't know."
"Friendly? Hostile?"
"Son, we don't know. The encryption seems similar, but we can't even be sure of that. All we have is
the location."
"So you're sending a team." You're sending me. We'd never gone to the Kuiper before. It had been
decades since we'd even sent robots. Not that we lacked the capacity. We just hadn't bothered;
everything we needed was so much closer to home. The Interplanetary Age had stagnated at the
asteroids.
But now something lurked at the furthest edge of our backyard, calling into the void. Maybe it was
talking to some other solar system. Maybe it was talking to something closer, something en route.
"It's not the kind of situation we can safely ignore," my father said.
"What about probes?"
"Of course. But we can't wait for them to report back. The follow-up's been fast-tracked; updates can
be sent en route."
He gave me a few extra seconds to digest that. When I still didn't speak, he said, "You have to
understand. Our only edge is that as far as we know, Burns-Caulfield doesn't know we're on to it. We
have to get as much as we can in whatever window of opportunity that grants us."
But Burns-Caulfield had hidden itself. Burns-Caulfield might not welcome a forced introduction.
"What if I refuse?"
The timelag seemed to say Mars.
"I know you, son. You won't."
"But if I did. If I'm the best qualified, if the job's so vital..."
He didn't have to answer. I didn't have to ask. At these kind of stakes, mission-critical elements didn't
get the luxury of choice. I wouldn't even have the childish satisfaction of holding my breath and
refusing to play—the will to resist is no less mechanical than ^Page-50

[[Chapter-3#^Page-51]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-51
the urge to breathe. Both can be
subverted with the right neurochemical keys.
"You killed my Kurzweill contract," I realized.
"That's the least of what we did."
We let the vacuum between us speak for a while.
"If I could go back and undo the—the thing that made you what you are," Dad said after a while, "I
would. In a second."
"Yeah."
"I have to go. I just wanted to give you the heads-up."
"Yeah. Thanks."
"I love you, son."
Where are you? Are you coming back?
"Thanks," I said again. "That's good to know."
*
This is what my father could not unmake. This is what I am:
I am the bridge between the bleeding edge and the dead center. I stand between the Wizard of Oz and
the man behind the curtain.
I am the curtain.
I am not an entirely new breed. My roots reach back to the dawn of civilization but those precursors
served a different function, a less honorable one. They only greased the wheels of social stability; they
would sugarcoat unpleasant truths, or inflate imaginary bogeymen for political expedience. They were
vital enough in their way. Not even the most heavily-armed police state can exert brute force on all of
its citizens all of the time. Meme management is so much subtler; the rose-tinted refraction of
perceived reality, the contagious fear of threatening alternatives. There have always been those tasked
with the rotation of informational topologies, but throughout most of history they had little to do with
increasing its clarity.
The new Millennium changed all that. We've surpassed ourselves now, we're exploring terrain beyond
the limits of merely human understanding. Sometimes its contours, even in conventional space, ^Page-51

[[Chapter-3#^Page-52]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-52
are
just too intricate for our brains to track; other times its very axes extend into dimensions
inconceivable to minds built to fuck and fight on some prehistoric grassland. So many things constrain
us, from so many directions. The most altruistic and sustainable philosophies fail before the brute
brain-stem imperative of self-interest. Subtle and elegant equations predict the behavior of the
quantum world, but none can explain it. After four thousand years we can't even prove that reality
exists beyond the mind of the first-person dreamer. We have such need of intellects greater than our
own.
But we're not very good at building them. The forced matings of minds and electrons succeed and fail
with equal spectacle. Our hybrids become as brilliant as savants, and as autistic. We graft people to
prosthetics, make their overloaded motor strips juggle meat and machinery, and shake our heads when
their fingers twitch and their tongues stutter. Computers bootstrap their own offspring, grow so wise
and incomprehensible that their communiqués assume the hallmarks of dementia: unfocused and
irrelevant to the barely-intelligent creatures left behind.
And when your surpassing creations find the answers you asked for, you can't understand their
analysis and you can't verify their answers. You have to take their word on faith—
—Or you use information theory to flatten it for you, to squash the tesseract into two dimensions and
the Klein bottle into three, to simplify reality and pray to whatever Gods survived the millennium that
your honorable twisting of the truth hasn't ruptured any of its load-bearing pylons. You hire people
like me; the crossbred progeny of profilers and proof assistants and information theorists.
In formal settings you'd call me Synthesist. On the street you call me jargonaut or poppy. If you're one
of those savants whose hard-won truths are being bastardized and lobotomized for powerful know-
nothings interested only in market share, you might call me a mole or a chaperone. ^Page-52

[[Chapter-3#^Page-53]] ~Chapter-3 ~Page-53
If you're Isaac Szpindel you'd call me commissar, and while the jibe would be a friendly one, it would
also be more than that.
I've never convinced myself that we made the right choice. I can cite the usual justifications in my
sleep, talk endlessly about the rotational topology of information and the irrelevance of semantic
comprehension. But after all the words, I'm still not sure. I don't know if anyone else is, either. Maybe
it's just some grand consensual con, marks and players all in league. We won't admit that our creations
are beyond us; they may speak in tongues, but our priests can read those signs. Gods leave their
algorithms carved into the mountainside but it's just li'l ol' me bringing the tablets down to the
masses, and I don't threaten anyone.
Maybe the Singularity happened years ago. We just don't want to admit we were left behind. ^Page-53
