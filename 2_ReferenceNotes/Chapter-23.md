"You cannot prevent and prepare for war at the same time."
—Einstein
I have no idea whether the scrambler made it back home with its hard-won prize. There was so much
lost distance to make up, even if the emplacements didn't pick it off en route. Cunningham's pistol
might have run out of fuel. And who knew how long those creatures could survive in vacuum anyway?
Maybe there'd been no real hope of success, maybe that scrambler was dead from the moment it had
gambled on staying behind. I never found out. It had dwindled and vanished from my sight long before
Rorschach dove beneath the clouds and disappeared in turn.
There had always been three, of course. Stretch, and Clench, and the half-forgotten microwaved
remains of a scrambler killed by an uppity grunt—kept on ice next to its living brethren, within easy
reach of Cunningham's teleops. I tried to dredge half-glimpsed details from memory, after the fact:
had both of those escapees been spheres, or had one been flattened along one axis? Had they thrashed,
waved their limbs the way some panicky human might with no ground beneath him? Or had one,
perhaps, coasted lifeless and ballistic until our guns destroyed the evidence?
At this point, it didn't really matter. What mattered was that at long last, everyone was on the same
page. Blood had been drawn, war declared. ^Page-332

[[Chapter-23#^Page-333]] #Chapter-23 #Page-333
And Theseus was paralysed from the waist down.
Rorschach's parting shot had punched through the carapace at the base of the spine. It had just missed
the ramscoop and the telematter assembly. It might have taken out Fab if it hadn't spent so many
joules burning through the carapace, but barring some temporary pulse effects it left all critical
systems pretty much operational. All it had done was weaken Theseus' backbone enough to make it
snap in two should we ever burn hard enough to break orbit. The ship would be able to repair that
damage, but not in time.
If it had been luck it would have been remarkable.
And now, its quarry disabled, Rorschach had vanished. It had everything it needed from us, for the
moment at least. It had information: all the experiences and insights encoded in the salvaged limbs of
its martyred spies. If Stretch-or-Clench's gamble had paid off it even had a specimen of its own now,
which all things considered we could hardly begrudge it. And so now it lurked invisibly in the depths,
resting perhaps. Recharging.
But it would be back.
Theseus lost weight for the final round. We shut down the drum in a token attempt to reduce our
vulnerable allotment of moving parts. The Gang of Four—uncommanded, unneeded, the very reason
for their existence ripped away—retreated into some inner dialog to which other flesh was
unwelcome. She floated in the observatory, her eyes closed as tightly as the leaded lids around her. I
could not tell who was in control.
I guessed. "Michelle?"
"Siri—" Susan. "Just go."
Bates floated near the floor of the drum, windows arrayed externally across bulkhead and conference
table. "What can I do?" I asked.
She didn't look up. "Nothing."
So I watched. Bates counted skimmers in one window—mass, ^Page-333

[[Chapter-23#^Page-334]] #Chapter-23 #Page-334
inertia, any of a dozen variables that
would prove far too constant should any of those shovelnosed missiles come at our throat. They had
finally noticed us. Their chaotic electron-dance was shifting now, hundreds of thousands of colossal
sledgehammers in sudden flux, reweaving into some ominous dynamic that hadn't yet settled into
anything we could predict.
In another window Rorschach's vanishing act replayed on endless loop: a radar image receding deep
into the maelstrom, fading beneath gaseous teratonnes of radio static. It might still be an orbit, of
sorts. Judging by that last glimpsed trajectory Rorschach might well be swinging around Ben's core
now, passing through crushed layers of methane and monoxide that would flatten Theseus into smoke.
Maybe it didn't even stop there; maybe Rorschach could pass unharmed even through those vaster,
deeper pressures that made iron and hydrogen run liquid.
We didn't know. We only knew that it would be back in a little under two hours, assuming it
maintained its trajectory and survived the depths. And of course, it would survive. You can't kill the
thing under the bed. You can only keep it outside the covers.
And only for a while.
A thumbnail inset caught my eye with a flash of color. At my command it grew into a swirling soap
bubble, incongruously beautiful, a blue-shifted coruscating rainbow of blown glass. I didn't recognize
it for a moment: Big Ben, rendered in some prismatic false-color enhance I'd never seen before. I
grunted softly.
Bates glanced up. "Oh. Beautiful, isn't it?"
"What's the spectrum?"
"Longwave stuff. Visible red, infra, down a ways. Good for heat traces."
"Visible red?" There wasn't any to speak of; mostly cool plasma fractals in a hundred shades of jade
and sapphire.
"Quadrochromatic palette," Bates told me. "Like what a cat might see. Or a vampire." She managed a
half-hearted wave at the ^Page-334

[[Chapter-23#^Page-335]] #Chapter-23 #Page-335
rainbow bubble. "Sarasti sees something like that every time he looks outside.
If he ever looks outside."
"You'd think he'd have mentioned it," I murmured. It was gorgeous, a holographic ornament. Perhaps
even Rorschach might be a work of art through eyes like these...
"I don't think they parse sight like we do." Bates opened another window. Mundane graphs and contour
plots sprang from the table. "They don't even go to Heaven, from what I hear. VR doesn't work on
them, they— see the pixels, or something."
"What if he's right?" I asked. I told myself that I was only looking for a tactical assessment, an official
opinion for the official record. But my words came out doubtful and frightened.
She paused. For a moment I wondered if she, too, had finally lost patience with the sight of me. But
she only looked up, and stared off into some enclosed distance.
"What if he's right," she repeated, and pondered the question that lay beneath: what can we do?
"We could engineer ourselves back into nonsentience, perhaps. Might improve our odds in the long
run." She looked at me, a rueful sort of half-smile at the corner of her mouth. "But I guess that
wouldn't be much of a win, would it? What's the difference between being dead, and just not knowing
you're alive?"
I finally saw it.
How long would it take an enemy tactician to discern Bates' mind behind the actions of her troops on
the battlefield? How long before the obvious logic came clear? In any combat situation, this woman
would naturally draw the greatest amount of enemy fire: take off the head, kill the body. But Amanda
Bates wasn't just a head: she was a bottleneck, and her body would not suffer from a decapitation
strike. Her death would only let her troops off the leash. How much more deadly would those grunts
be, once every battlefield reflex didn't have to pass through some interminable job stack waiting for
the rubber stamp? ^Page-335

[[Chapter-23#^Page-336]] #Chapter-23 #Page-336
Szpindel had had it all wrong. Amanda Bates wasn't a sop to politics, her role didn't deny the
obsolescence of Human oversight at all. Her role depended on it.
She was more cannon fodder than I. She always had been. And I had to admit: after generations of
generals who'd lived for the glory of the mushroom cloud, it was a pretty effective strategy for souring
warmongers on gratuitous violence. In Amanda Bates' army, picking a fight meant standing on the
battlefield with a bull's-eye on your chest.
No wonder she'd been so invested in peaceful alternatives.
"I'm sorry," I said softly.
She shrugged. "It's not over yet. Just the first round." She took a long, deep breath, and turned back to
her study of slingshot mechanics. "Rorschach wouldn't have tried so hard to scare us off in the first
place if we couldn't touch it, right?"
I swallowed. "Right."
"So there's still a chance." She nodded to herself. "There's still a chance."
*
The demon arranged his pieces for the end game. He didn't have many left. The soldier he placed in
the bridge. He packed obsolete linguists and diplomats back in their coffin, out of sight and out of the
way.
He called the jargonaut to his quarters— and although it would be the first time I'd seen him since the
attack, his summons carried not the slightest trace of doubt that I would obey. I did. I came on
command, and saw that he had surrounded himself with faces.
Every last one of them was screaming.
There was no sound. The disembodied holograms floated in silent tiers around the bubble, each
contorted into a different expression of pain. They were being tortured, these faces; half a dozen real
ethnicities and twice as many hypothetical ones, skin tones ranging ^Page-336

[[Chapter-23#^Page-337]] #Chapter-23 #Page-337
from charcoal to albino, brows
high and slanted, noses splayed or pointed, jaws receding or prognathous. Sarasti had called the entire
hominid tree into existence around him, astonishing in their range of features, terrifying in their
consistency of expression.
A sea of tortured faces, rotating in slow orbits around my vampire commander.
"My God, what is this?"
"Statistics." Sarasti seemed focused on a flayed Asian child. "Rorschach's growth allometry over a
two-week period."
"They're faces..."
He nodded, turning his attention to a woman with no eyes. "Skull diameter scales to total mass.
Mandible length scales to EM transparency at one Angstrom. One hundred thirteen facial dimensions,
each presenting a different variable. Principle-component combinations present as multifeature aspect
ratios." He turned to face me, his naked gleaming eyes just slightly sidecast. "You'd be surprised how
much gray matter is dedicated to the analysis of facial imagery. Shame to waste it on anything as—
counterintuitive as residual plots or contingency tables."
I felt my jaw clenching. "And the expressions? What do they represent?"
"Software customizes output for user."
An agonized gallery pled for mercy on all sides.
"I am wired for hunting," he reminded gently.
"And you think I don't know that," I said after a moment.
He shrugged, disconcertingly human. "You ask."
"Why am I here, Jukka? You want to teach me another object lesson?"
"To discuss our next move."
"What move? We can't even run away."
"No." He shook his head, baring filed teeth in something approaching regret.
"Why did we wait so long?" Suddenly my sullen defiance had ^Page-337

[[Chapter-23#^Page-338]] #Chapter-23 #Page-338
evaporated. I sounded like a child,
frightened and pleading. "Why didn't we just take it on when we first got here, when it was
weaker...?"
"We need to learn things. For next time."
"Next time? I thought Rorschach was a dandelion seed. I thought it just—washed up here—"
"By chance. But every dandelion is a clone. Their seeds are legion." Another smile, not remotely
convincing— "And maybe it takes more than one try for the placental mammals to conquer Australia."
"It'll annihilate us. It doesn't even need those spitballs, it could pulverize us with one of those
scramjets. In an instant."
"It doesn't want to."
"How do you know?"
"They need to learn things too. They want us intact. Improves our odds."
"Not enough. We can't win."
This was his cue. This was the point at which Uncle Predator would smile at my naiveté, and take me
into his confidence. Of course we're armed to the teeth, he would say. Do you think we'd come all this
way, face such a vast unknown, without the means to defend ourselves? Now, at last, I can reveal that
shielding and weaponry account for over half the ship's mass...
It was his cue.
"No," he said. "We can't win."
"So we just sit here. We just wait to die for the next—the next sixty-eight minutes..."
Sarasti shook his head. "No."
"But—" I began.
"Oh," I finished.
Because of course, we had just topped up our antimatter reserves. Theseus was not equipped with
weapons. Theseus was the weapon. And we were, in fact, going to sit here for the next sixty-eight
minutes, waiting to die. ^Page-338

[[Chapter-23#^Page-339]] #Chapter-23 #Page-339
But we were going to take Rorschach with us when we did.
Sarasti said nothing. I wondered what he saw, looking at me. I wondered if there actually was a Jukka
Sarasti behind those eyes to see, if his insights—always ten steps ahead of our own— hailed not so
much from superior analytical facilities as from the timeworn truth that it takes one to know one.
Whose side, I wondered, would an automaton take?
"You have other things to worry about," he said.
He moved towards me; I swear, all those agonized faces followed him with their eyes. He studied me
for a moment, the flesh crinkling around his eyes. Or maybe some mindless algorithm merely
processed visual input, correlated aspect ratios and facial tics, fed everything to some output
subroutine with no more awareness than a stats program. Maybe there was no more spark in this
creature's face than there was in all the others, silently screaming in his wake.
"Is Susan afraid of you?" the thing before me asked.
"Su—why should she be?"
"She has four conscious entities in her head. She's four times more sentient than you. Doesn't that
make you a threat?"
"No, of course not."
"Then why should you feel threatened by me?"
And suddenly I didn't care any more. I laughed out loud, with minutes to live and nothing to lose.
"Why? Maybe because you're my natural enemy, you fucker. Maybe because I know you, and you can't
even look at one of us without flexing your claws. Maybe because you nearly ripped my fucking hand
off and raped me for no good reason—"
"I can imagine what it's like," he said quietly. "Please don't make me do it again."
I fell instantly silent.
"I know your race and mine are never on the best of terms." There was a cold smile in his voice if not
on his face. "But I do only ^Page-339

[[Chapter-23#^Page-340]] #Chapter-23 #Page-340
what you force me to. You rationalize, Keeton. You defend. You reject
unpalatable truths, and if you can't reject them outright you trivialize them. Incremental evidence is
never enough for you. You hear rumors of Holocaust; you dismiss them. You see evidence of
genocide; you insist it can't be so bad. Temperatures rise, glaciers melt—species die—and you blame
sunspots and volcanoes. Everyone is like this, but you most of all. You and your Chinese Room. You
turn incomprehension into mathematics, you reject the truth without even knowing what it is."
"It served me well enough." I wondered at the ease with which I had put my life into the past tense.
"Yes, if your purpose is only to transmit. Now you have to convince. You have to believe."
There were implications there I didn't dare to hope for. "Are you saying—"
"Can't afford to let the truth trickle through. Can't give you the chance to shore up your rationales and
your defenses. They must fall completely. You must be inundated. Shattered. Genocide's impossible
to deny when you're buried up to your neck in dismembered bodies."
He'd played me. All this time. Preconditioning me, turning my topology inside-out.
I'd known something was going on. I just hadn't understood what.
"I'd have seen right through it," I said, "if you hadn't made me get involved."
"You might even read it off me directly."
"That's why you—" I shook my head. "I thought that was because we were meat."
"That too," Sarasti admitted, and looked right at me.
For the first time, I looked right back. And felt a shock of recognition.
I still wonder why I never saw it before. For all those years I remembered the thoughts and feelings of
some different, younger person, some remnant of the boy my parents had hacked out of my head ^Page-340

[[Chapter-23#^Page-341]] #Chapter-23 #Page-341
to
make room for me. He'd been alive. His world had been vibrant. And though I could call up the
memories of that other consciousness, I could barely feel anything within the constraints of my own.
Perhaps dreamstate wasn't such a bad word for it...
"Like to hear a vampire folk tale?" Sarasti asked.
"Vampires have folk tales?"
He took it for a yes. "A laser is assigned to find the darkness. Since it lives in a room without doors, or
windows, or any other source of light, it thinks this will be easy. But everywhere it turns it sees
brightness. Every wall, every piece of furniture it points at is brightly lit. Eventually it concludes there
is no darkness, that light is everywhere."
"What the hell are you talking about?"
"Amanda is not planning a mutiny."
"What? You know about—"
"She doesn't even want to. Ask her if you like."
"No—I—"
"You value objectivity."
It was so obvious I didn't bother answering.
He nodded as if I had. "Synthesists can't have opinions of their own. So when you feel one, it must be
someone else's. The crew holds you in contempt. Amanda wants me relieved of command. Half of us
i s you. I think the word is project. Although,"—he cocked his head a bit to one side—"lately you
improve. Come."
"Where?"
"Shuttle bay. Time to do your job."
"My—"
"Survive and bear witness."
"A drone—"
"Can deliver the data—assuming nothing fries its memory before it gets away. It can't convince
anyone. It can't counter rationalizations and denials. It can't matter. And vampires—" he paused
—"have poor communications skills." ^Page-341

[[Chapter-23#^Page-342]] #Chapter-23 #Page-342
It should have been cause for petty, selfish rejoicing.
"It all comes down to me," I said. "That's what you're saying. I'm a fucking stenographer, and it's all
on me."
"Yes. Forgive me for that."
"Forgive you?"
Sarasti waved his hand. All faces save two disappeared.
"I don't know what I'm doing."
*
The news bloomed across ConSensus a few seconds before Bates called it aloud: Thirteen skimmers
had not reappeared from behind Big Ben on schedule. Sixteen. Twenty-eight.
And counting.
Sarasti clicked to himself as he and Bates played catch-up. Tactical filled with luminous multicolored
threads, a tangle of revised projections as intricate as art. The threads wrapped Ben like a filamentous
cocoon; Theseus was a naked speck in the middle distance.
I expected any number of those lines to skewer us like needles through a bug. Surprisingly, none did;
but the projections only extended twenty-five hours into the future, and were reliable for only half
that. Not even Sarasti and the Captain could look so far ahead with that many balls in the air. It was
something, though, the faintest silver lining: that all these high-speed behemoths couldn't simply
reach out and swat us without warning. Evidently they still had to ease into the curve.
After Rorschach's dive, I'd been starting to think the laws of physics didn't apply.
The trajectories were close enough, though. At least three skimmers would be passing within a
hundred kilometers on their next orbits.
Sarasti reached for his injector, the blood rising in his face. "Time to go. We refit Charybdis while
you're sulking." ^Page-342

[[Chapter-23#^Page-343]] #Chapter-23 #Page-343
He held the hypo to his throat and shot up. I stared at ConSensus, caught by that bright shifting web
like a moth by a streetlight.
"Now, Siri."
He pushed me from his quarters. I sailed into the passageway, grabbed a convenient rung—and
stopped.
The spine was alive with grunts, patrolling the airspace, standing guard over the fab plants and shuttle
'locks, clinging like giant insects to the rungs of unrolling spinal ladders. Slowly, silently, the spine
itself was stretching.
It could do that, I remembered. Its corrugations flexed and relaxed like muscle, it could grow up to
two hundred meters to accommodate any late-breaking need for a bigger hanger or more lab space.
Or more infantry. Theseus was increasing the size of the battlefield.
"Come." The vampire turned aft.
Bates broke in from up front. "Something's happening."
An emergency handpad, geckoed to the expanding bulkhead, slid past to one side. Sarasti grabbed it
and tapped commands. Bates' feed appeared on the bulkhead: a tiny chunk of Big Ben, an EM-
enhanced equatorial quadrant only a few thousand klicks on a side. The clouds boiled down there, a
cyclonic knot of turbulence swirling almost too fast for realtime. The overlay described charged
particles, bound in a deep Parker spiral. It spoke of great mass, rising.
Sarasti clicked.
"DTI?" Bates said.
"Optical only." Sarasti took my arm and dragged me effortlessly astern. The display paced us along
the bulkhead: seven skimmers shot from the clouds as I watched, a ragged circle of scramjets
screaming red-hot into space. ConSensus plotted their paths in an instant; luminous arcs rose around
our ship like the bars of a cage.
Theseus shuddered. ^Page-343

[[Chapter-23#^Page-344]] #Chapter-23 #Page-344
We've been hit, I thought. Suddenly the spine's plodding expansion cranked into overdrive; the pleated
wall lurched and accelerated, streaming past my outstretched fingers as the closed hatch receded up
ahead—
—receded overhead.
The walls weren't moving at all. We were falling, to the sudden strident bleating of an alarm.
Something nearly yanked my arm from its socket: Sarasti had reached out with one hand and caught a
rung, reached with his other and caught me before we'd both been flattened against the Fab plant. We
dangled. I must have weighed two hundred kilograms; the floor shuddered ten meters below my feet.
The ship groaned around us. The spine filled with the screech of torquing metal. Bates' grunts clung to
its walls with clawed feet.
I reached for the ladder. The ladder pulled away: the ship was bending in the middle and down had
started to climb the walls. Sarasti and I swung towards the center of the spine like a daisy-chain
pendulum.
"Bates! James!" The vampire roared. His grip on my wrist trembled, slipping. I strained for the ladder,
swung, caught it.
"Susan James has barricaded herself in the bridge and shut down autonomic overrides." An unfamiliar
voice, flat and affectless. "She has initiated an unauthorized burn. I have begun a controlled reactor
shutdown; be advised that the main drive will be offline for at least twenty-seven minutes."
The ship, I realized, its voice raised calmly above the alarm. The Captain itself. On Public Address.
That was unusual.
"Bridge!" Sarasti barked. "Open channel!"
Someone was shouting up there. There were words, but I couldn't make them out.
Without warning, Sarasti let go.
He dropped obliquely in a blur. Aft and opposite, the bulkhead ^Page-344

[[Chapter-23#^Page-345]] #Chapter-23 #Page-345
waited to swat him like an insect. In
half a second both his legs would be shattered, if the impact didn't kill him outright—
But suddenly we were weightless again, and Jukka Sarasti—purple-faced, stiff-limbed— was foaming
at the mouth.
"Reactor offline," the Captain reported. Sarasti bounced off the wall.
He's having a seizure, I realized.
I released the ladder and pushed astern. Theseus swung lopsidedly around me. Sarasti convulsed in
mid-air; clicks and hisses and choking sounds stuttered from his mouth. His eyes were so wide they
seemed lidless. His pupils were mirror-red pinpoints. The flesh twitched across his face as though
trying to crawl off.
Ahead and behind, battlebots held their position and ignored us.
"Bates!" I yelled up the spine. "We need help!"
Angles, everywhere. Seams on the shield plates. Sharp shadows and protrusions on the surface of
every drone. A two-by-three matrix of insets, bordered in black, floating over the main ConSensus
display: two big interlinked crosses right in front of where Sarasti had been hanging.
This can't be happening. He just took his antiEuclideans. I saw him. Unless...
Someone had spiked Sarasti's drugs.
"Bates!" She should be linked into the grunts, they should have leapt forward at the first sign of
trouble. They should be dragging my commander to the infirmary by now. They waited stolid and
immobile. I stared at the nearest: "Bates, you there?" And then—in case she wasn't—I spoke to the
grunt directly. "Are you autonomous? Do you take verbal orders?"
On all sides the robots watched; the Captain just laughed at me, its voice posing as an alarm.
Infirmary.
I pushed. Sarasti's arms flailed randomly against my head and shoulders. He tumbled forward and
sideways, hit the moving ^Page-345

[[Chapter-23#^Page-346]] #Chapter-23 #Page-346
ConSensus display dead center, bounced away up the spine. I kicked off in
his wake—
—and glimpsed something from the corner of my eye—
—and turned—
—And dead center of ConSensus, Rorschach erupted from Ben's seething face like a breaching whale.
It wasn't just the EM-enhance: the thing was glowing, deep angry red. Enraged, it hurled itself into
space, big as a mountain range.
Fuck fuck fuck.
Theseus lurched. The lights flickered, went out, came back on again. The turning bulkhead cuffed me
from behind.
"Backups engaged," the Captain said calmly.
"Captain! Sarasti's down!" I kicked off the nearest ladder, bumped into a grunt and headed forward
after the vampire. "Bates isn't—what do I do?"
"Nav offline. Starboard afferents offline."
It wasn't even talking to me, I realized. Maybe this wasn't the Captain at all. Maybe it was pure reflex:
a dialog tree, spouting public-service announcements. Maybe Theseus had already been lobotomized.
Maybe this was only her brain stem talking.
Darkness again. Then flickering light.
If the Captain was gone, we were screwed.
I gave Sarasti another push. The alarm bleated on. The drum was twenty meters ahead; BioMed was
just the other side of that closed hatch. The hatch had been open before, I remembered. Someone had
shut it in the last few minutes. Fortunately Theseus had no locks on her doors.
Unless the Gang barricaded it before they took the bridge...
"Strap in, people! We are getting out of here!"
Who in hell...?
The open bridge channel. Susan James, shouting up there. Or someone was; I couldn't quite place the
voice... ^Page-346

[[Chapter-23#^Page-347]] #Chapter-23 #Page-347
Ten meters to the drum. Theseus jerked again, slowed her spin. Stabilised.
"Somebody start the goddamned reactor! I've only got attitude jets up here!"
"Susan? Sascha?" I was at the hatch. "Who is that?" I pushed passed Sarasti and reached to open it.
No answer.
Not from ConSensus, anyway. I heard a muted hum from behind, saw the ominous shifting of shadows
on the bulkhead just a moment too late. I turned in time to see one of the grunts raise a spiky
appendage—curved like a scimitar, needle-tipped—over Sarasti's head.
I turned in time to see it plunge into his skull.
I froze. The metal proboscis withdrew, dark and slick. Lateral maxillipeds began nibbling at the base
of Sarasti's skull. His pithed corpse wasn't thrashing now; it only trembled, a sack of muscles and
motor nerves awash in static.
Bates.
Her mutiny was underway. No, their mutiny—Bates and the Gang. I'd known. I'd imagined it. I'd seen
it coming.
He hadn't believed me.
The lights went out again. The alarm fell silent. ConSensus dwindled to a flickering doodle on the
bulkhead and disappeared; I saw something there in that last instant, and refused to process it. I heard
breath catch in my throat, felt angular monstrosities advancing through the darkness. Something flared
directly ahead, a bright brief staccato in the void. I glimpsed curves and angles in silhouette,
staggering. The buzzing crackle of shorting circuitry. Metal objects collided nearby, unseen.
From behind the crinkle of the drum hatch, opening. A sudden beam of harsh chemical light hit me as
I turned, lit the mechanical ranks behind; they simultaneously unclamped from their anchorages ^Page-347

[[Chapter-23#^Page-348]] #Chapter-23 #Page-348
and
floated free. Their joints clicked in unison like an army stamping to attention
"Keeton!" Bates snapped, sailing through the hatch. "You okay?"
The chemlight shone from her forehead. It turned the interior of the spine into a high-contrast mosaic,
all pale surfaces and sharp moving shadows. It spilled across the grunt that had killed Sarasti; the
robot bounced down the spine, suddenly, mysteriously inert. The light washed across Sarasti's body.
The corpse turned slowly on its axis. Spherical crimson beads emerged from its head like drops of
water from a leaky faucet. They spread in a winding, widening trail, spot-lit by Bates' headlamp: a
spiral arm of dark ruby suns.
I backed away. "You—"
She pushed me to one side. "Stay clear of the hatch, unless you're going through." Her eyes were fixed
on the ranked drones. "Optical line of sight."
Rows of glassy eyes reflected back at us down the passageway, passing in and out of shadow.
"You killed Sarasti!"
"No."
"But—"
"Who do you think shut it down, Keeton? The fucker went rogue. I could barely even get it to self-
destruct." Her eyes went briefly deep-focus; all down the spine the surviving drones launched into
some intricate martial ballet, half-seen in the shifting cone of her headlamp.
"Better," Bates said. "They should stay in line now. Assuming we don't get hit with anything too much
stronger."
"What is hitting us?"
"Lightning. EMP." Drones sailed down to Fab and the shuttles, taking strategic positions along the
tube. "Rorschach's putting out one hell of a charge and every time one those skimmers pass between
us they arc."
"What, at this range? I thought we were—the burn—" ^Page-348

[[Chapter-23#^Page-349]] #Chapter-23 #Page-349
"Sent us in the wrong direction. We're inbound."
Three grunts floated close enough to touch. They drew beads on the open drum hatch.
"She said she was trying to escape—" I remembered.
"She fucked up."
"Not by that much. She couldn't have." We were all rated for manual piloting. Just in case.
"Not the Gang," Bates said.
"But—"
"I think there's someone new in there now. Bunch of submodules wired together and woke up
somehow, I don't know. But whatever's in charge, I think it's just panicking."
Stuttering brightness on all sides. The spinal lightstrips flickered and finally held steady, at half their
usual brightness.
Theseus coughed static and spoke: "ConSensus is offline. Reac—"
The voice faded.
ConSensus, I remembered as Bates turned to head back upstream.
"I saw something," I said. "Before ConSensus went out."
"Yeah."
"Was that—"
She paused at the hatch. "Yeah."
I'd seen scramblers. Hundreds of them, sailing naked through the void, their arms spread wide.
Some of their arms, anyway. "They were carrying—"
Bates nodded. "Weapons." Her eyes flickered to some unseen distance for a moment. "First wave
headed for the front end. Blister and forward lock, I think. Second wave's aft." She shook her head.
"Huh. I would have done it the other way around."
"How far?"
"Far?" Bates smiled faintly. "They're already on the hull, Siri. We're engaging."
"What do I do? What do I do?"
Her eyes stared past me, and widened. She opened her mouth. ^Page-349

A hand clamped on my shoulder from behind and spun me around.
Sarasti. His dead eyes stared from a skull split like a spiked melon. Globules of coagulating blood
clung to his hair and skin like engorged ticks.
"Go with him," Bates said.
Sarasti grunted and clicked. There were no words.
"What—" I began.
"Now. That's an order." Bates turned back to the hatch. "We'll cover you."
The shuttle. "You too."
"No."
"Why not? They can fight better without you, you said that yourself! What's the point?"
"Can't leave yourself a back door, Keeton. Defeats the whole purpose." She allowed herself a small,
sad smile. "They've breached. Go."
She was gone, fresh alarms rising in her wake. Far towards the bow I heard the crinkle of emergency
bulkheads snapping shut.
Sarasti's undead carcass gurgled and pushed me down the spine. Four more grunts slid smoothly past
and took up position behind us. I looked over my shoulder in time to see the vampire pull the handpad
from the wall. But it wasn't Sarasti at all, of course. It was the Captain—whatever was left of the
Captain, this far into the fight—commandeering a peripheral interface for its own use. The optical
port sprouted conspicuously from the back of Sarasti's neck, where the cable used to go in; I
remembered the drone's maxillipeds, chewing.
The sound of weapons fire and ricochets rose behind us.
The corpse typed one-handed as we moved. I wondered briefly why it just didn't talk before my gaze
flickered back to the spike in his brain: Sarasti's speech centers must be mush.
"Why did you kill him?" I said. A whole new alarm started up, ^Page-350

[[Chapter-23#^Page-351]] #Chapter-23 #Page-351
way back in the drum. A sudden breeze
tugged me backward for a moment, dissipated in the next second with a distant clang.
The corpse held out the handpad, configured for keys and a text display: Seizng. Cldnt cntrl.
We were at the shuttle locks. Robot soldiers let us pass, their attention elsewhere.
U go, the Captain said.
Someone screamed in the distance. Way off up the spine, the drum hatch slammed shut; I turned and
saw a pair of distant grunts welding the seal. They seemed to move faster now than they ever had
before. Maybe it was only my imagination.
The starboard shuttle lock slid back. Charybdis' interior lights winked on, spilling brightness into the
passageway; the spine's emergency lighting seemed even dimmer in contrast. I peered through the
opening. There was almost no cabin space left—just a single open coffin jammed between coolant and
fuel tanks and massive retrofitted shockpads. Charybdis had been refitted for high-G and long
distance.
And me.
Sarasti's corpse urged me on from behind. I turned and faced it.
"Was it ever him?" I asked.
Go.
"Tell me. Did he ever speak for himself? Did he decide anything on his own? Were we ever following
his orders, or was it just you all along?"
Sarasti's undead eyes stared glassy and uncomprehending. His fingers jerked on the handpad.
U dislke ordrs frm mchnes. Happier ths way.
I let it strap me in and close the lid. I lay there in the dark, feeling my body lurch and sway as the
shuttle slid into its launch slot. I withstood the sudden silence as the docking clamps let go, the jerk of
acceleration that spat me hard into the vacuum, the ongoing thrust that pushed against my chest like a
soft mountain. Around ^Page-351

me the shuttle trembled in the throes of a burn that far exceeded its normative
specs.
My inlays came back online. Suddenly I could see outside if I wanted. I could see what was happening
behind me.
I chose not to, deliberately and fervently, and looked anyway.
Theseus was dwindling by then, even on tactical. She listed down the well, wobbling toward some
enemy rendezvous that must have been intentional, some last-second maneuver to get her payload as
close to target as possible. Rorschach rose to meet her, its gnarled spiky arms uncoiling, spreading as
if in anticipation of an embrace. But it was the backdrop, not the players, that stole the tableau: the
face of Big Ben roiling in my rearview, a seething cyclonic backdrop filling the window. Magnetic
contours wound spring-tight on the overlay; Rorschach was drawing all of Ben's magnetosphere
around itself like a bright swirling cloak, twisting it into a concentrated knot that grew and brightened
and bulged outward...
Like a torsion flare from an L-class dwarf, my commander had said once, but we should see anything
big enough to generate that effect and the sky's dark on that bearing. IAU calls it a statistical artefact.
As, in fact, it had been. An impact splash perhaps, or the bright brief bellow of some great energy
source rebooting after a million years of dormancy. Much like this one: a solar flare, with no sun
beneath it. A magnetic cannon ten thousand times stronger than nature gave it any right to be.
Both sides drew their weapons. I don't know which fired first, or even if it mattered: how many tonnes
of antimatter would it take to match something that could squeeze the power of a sun from a gas ball
barely wider than Jupiter? Was Rorschach also resigned to defeat, had each side opted for a kamikaze
strike on the other?
I don't know. Big Ben got in the way just minutes before the explosion. That's probably why I'm still
alive. Ben stood between me and that burning light like a coin held against the sun.
Theseus sent everything it could, until the last microsecond. ^Page-352

Every recorded moment of hand-to-hand
combat, every last countdown, every last soul. All the moves and all the vectors. I have that telemetry.
I can break it down into any number of shapes, continuous or discrete. I can transform the topology,
rotate it and compress it and serve it up in dialects that any ally might be able to use. Perhaps Sarasti
was right, perhaps some of it is vital.
I don't know what any of it means. ^Page-353
