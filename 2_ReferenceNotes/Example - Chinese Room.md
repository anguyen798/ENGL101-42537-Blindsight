-   The Hare quote. “They know the music but not the words”
    
-   Music can have words
    
-   You can know music and words without understanding those words
    
-   The quote comes from Without Conscience
    
-   They constitute a third party, or something separate from the speaker
    
-   The Hare quote connects to the concept of The Chinese Room, which suggests…it is possible to absorb and respond to language without understanding signification
    
-   The quote links to Siri Keeton because he describes himself as a Chinese Room per his occupation; he is a superlative observer, but one that doesn’t necessarily understand what he observers
    
-   Rorschach’s communications patiently tell Sasha of the Gang that the alien is responding but not understanding; it is a Chinese Room and cannot feel insulted.



When Sasha tells Rorschach to “Suck[…] dick,”she’s purposefully escalating the initial contact between it and her crew because she believes that Rorschach is "just a Chinese Room”, a reference that connects(I) to the notable quote a few pages earlier from Robert Hare’s Without Conscience (1993). The Hare quote “They know the music but not the words”is notable not only for its approximation of the Chinese Room(II) that famous thought experiment where a person can learn and use a language without understanding what their words mean, but also because of the source(III); it is where the early Ted Bundy quote that opens the novel encourages the reader to ignore the past as it's "only a dream” is located(IV).
