"All kinds of animals living here. Occasional demons too."
— Ian Anderson, Catfish Rising
The Third Wave, they called us. All in the same boat, driving into the long dark courtesy of a
bleeding-edge prototype crash-graduated from the simulators a full eighteen months ahead of
schedule. In a less fearful economy, such violence to the timetable would have bankrupted four
countries and fifteen multicorps.
The first two waves came out of the gate in even more of a hurry. I didn't find out what had happened
to them until thirty minutes before the briefing, when Sarasti released the telemetry into ConSensus.
Then I opened wide; experience flooded up my inlays and spilled across my parietal cortex in glorious
high-density fast forward. Even now I can bring those data back, fresh as the day they were recorded.
I'm there.
I'm them.
I am unmanned. I am disposable. I am souped-up and stripped-down, a telematter drive with a couple
of cameras bolted to the front end, pushing gees that would turn meat to jelly. I sprint joyously toward
the darkness, my twin brother a stereoscopic hundred klicks to starboard, dual streams of backspat
pions boosting us to relativity before poor old Theseus had even crawled past Mars.
But now, six billion kilometers to stern, Mission Control turns off ^Page-54

[[Chapter-4#^Page-55]] 
the tap and leaves us coasting. The
comet swells in our sights, a frozen enigma sweeping its signal across the sky like a lighthouse beam.
We bring rudimentary senses to bear and stare it down on a thousand wavelengths.
We've lived for this moment.
We see an erratic wobble that speaks of recent collisions. We see scars—smooth icy expanses where
once-acned skin has liquefied and refrozen, far too recently for the insignificant sun at our backs to be
any kind of suspect.
We see an astronomical impossibility: a comet with a heart of refined iron.
Burns-Caufield sings as we glide past. Not to us; it ignores our passage as it ignored our approach. It
sings to someone else entirely. Perhaps we'll meet that audience some day. Perhaps they're waiting in
the desolate wastelands ahead of us. Mission Control flips us onto our backs, keeps us fixed on target
past any realistic hope of acquisition. They send last-ditch instructions, squeeze our fading signals for
every last bit among the static. I can sense their frustration, their reluctance to let us go; once or
twice, we're even asked if some judicious mix of thrust and gravity might let us linger here a bit
longer.
But deceleration is for pansies. We're headed for the stars.
Bye, Burnsie. Bye, Mission Control. Bye, Sol.
See you at heat death.
Warily, we close on target.
There are three of us in the second wave—slower than our predecessors, yes, but still so much faster
than anything flesh-constrained. We are weighed down by payloads which make us virtually
omniscient. We see on every wavelength, from radio to string. Our autonomous microprobes measure
everything our masters anticipated; ^Page-55

[[Chapter-4#^Page-56]] 
tiny onboard assembly lines can build tools from the atoms up, to
assess the things they did not. Atoms, scavenged from where we are, join with ions beamed from where
we were: thrust and materiel accumulate in our bellies.
This extra mass has slowed us, but midpoint braking maneuvers have slowed us even more. The last
half of this journey has been a constant fight against momentum from the first. It is not an efficient
way to travel. In less-hurried times we would have built early to some optimal speed, perhaps slung
around a convenient planet for a little extra oomph, coasted most of the way. But time is pressing, so
we burn at both ends. We must reach our destination; we cannot afford to pass it by, cannot afford the
kamikaze exuberance of the first wave. They merely glimpsed the lay of the land. We must map it down
to the motes.
We must be more responsible.
Now, slowing towards orbit, we see everything they saw and more. We see the scabs, and the
impossible iron core. We hear the singing. And there, just beneath the comet's frozen surface, we see
structure: an infiltration of architecture into geology. We are not yet close enough to squint, and
radar is too long in the tooth for fine detail. But we are smart, and there are three of us, widely
separated in space. The wavelengths of three radar sources can be calibrated to interfere at some
predetermined point of convergence—and those tripartite echoes, hologramatically remixed, will
increase resolution by a factor of twenty-seven.
Burns-Caulfield stops singing the moment we put our plan into action. In the next instant I go blind.
It's a temporary aberration, a reflexive amping of filters to compensate for the overload. My arrays
are back online in seconds, diagnostics green within and without. I reach out to the others, confirm
identical experiences, identical recoveries. We are all still fully functional, unless the sudden increase
in ambient ion density is some ^Page-56

[[Chapter-4#^Page-57]] 
kind of sensory artefact. We are ready to continue our investigation of
Burns-Caulfield.
The only real problem is that Burns-Caulfield seems to have disappeared...
Theseus carried no regular crew—no navigators or engineers, no one to swab the decks, no meat
wasted on tasks that machinery orders of mag smaller could perform orders of mag better. Let
superfluous deckhands weigh down other ships, if the nonAscendent hordes needed to attach some
pretense of usefulness to their lives. Let them infest vessels driven only by commercial priorities. The
only reason we were here was because nobody had yet optimized software for First Contact. Bound
past the edge of the solar system, already freighted with the fate of the world, Theseus wasted no mass
on self-esteem.
So here we were, rehydrated and squeaky-clean: Isaac Szpindel, to study the aliens. The Gang of Four
—Susan James and her secondary personae— to talk to them. Major Amanda Bates was here to fight,
if necessary. And Jukka Sarasti to command us all, to move us like chess pieces on some
multidimensional game board that only vampires could see.
He'd arrayed us around a conference table that warped gently through the Commons, keeping a
discreet and constant distance from the curved deck beneath. The whole drum was furnished in Early
Concave, tricked unwary and hung-over brains into thinking they were looking at the world through
fisheye lenses. In deference to the creakiness of the nouveaux undead it spun at a mere fifth of a gee,
but it was just warming up. We'd be at half-grav in six hours, stuck there for eighteen out of every
twenty-four until the ship decided we were fully recovered. For the next few days, free-fall would be a
rare and blesséd thing.
Light sculptures appeared on the tabletop. Sarasti could have fed ^Page-57

[[Chapter-4#^Page-58]] 
the information directly to our inlays
— the whole briefing could have gone through ConSensus, without the need to assemble physically in
the same place— but if you want to be sure everyone's paying attention, you bring them together.
Szpindel leaned in conspiratorially at my side. "Or maybe the bloodsucker just gets off seeing all this
meat in close quarters, eh?"
If Sarasti heard he didn't show it, not even to me. He pointed to a dark heart at the center of the
display, his eyes lost behind black glass. "Oasa object. Infrared emitter, methane class."
On the display it was—nothing. Our apparent destination was a black disk, a round absence of stars. In
real life it weighed in at over ten Jupiters and measured twenty percent wider at the belly. It was
directly in our path: too small to burn, too remote for the reflection of distant sunlight, too heavy for a
gas giant, too light for a brown dwarf.
"When did that show up?" Bates squeezed her rubber ball in one hand, the knuckles whitening.
"X-ray spike appears during the '76 microwave survey." Six years before Firefall. "Never confirmed,
never reacquired. Like a torsion flare from an L-class dwarf, but we should see anything big enough to
generate that kind of effect and the sky's dark on that bearing. IAU calls it a statistical artefact."
Szpindel's eyebrows drew together like courting caterpillers. "What changed?"
Sarasti smiled faintly, keeping his mouth closed. "The metabase gets—crowded, after Firefall.
Everyone skittish, looking for clues. After Burns-Caulfield explodes—" He clicked at the back of his
throat. "Turns out the spike might arise from a subdwarf object after all, if the magnetosphere's
torqued enough."
Bates: "Torqued by what?"
"Don't know."
Layers of statistical inference piled up on the table while Sarasti sketched background: even with a
solid bearing and half the world's attention, the object had hidden from all but the most intensive ^Page-58

[[Chapter-4#^Page-59]] 
search. A thousand telescopic snapshots had been stacked one on another and squeezed through a
dozen filters before something emerged from the static, just below the three-meter band and the
threshold of certainty. For the longest time it hadn't even been real: just a probabilistic ghost until
Theseus got close enough to collapse the waveform. A quantum particle, heavy as ten Jupiters.
Earthbound cartographers were calling it Big Ben. Theseus had barely passed Saturn's orbit when it
showed up in the residuals. That discovery would have been moot for anyone else; no other ship
caught en route could have packed enough fuel for anything but the long dejected loop back home. But
Theseus' thin, infinitely attenuate fuel line reached all the way back to the sun; she could turn on the
proverbial dime. We'd changed course in our sleep and the Icarus stream tracked our moves like a cat
after prey, feeding us at lightspeed.
And here we were.
"Talk about long shots," Szpindel grumbled.
Across the table, Bates flicked her wrist. Her ball sailed over my head; I heard it bounce off the deck
(not the deck, something in me amended: handrail). "We're assuming the comet was a deliberate
decoy, then."
Sarasti nodded. The ball riccocheted back into my line of sight high overhead and disappeared briefly
behind the spinal bundle, looping through some eccentric, counterintuitive parabola in the drum's
feeble grav.
"So they want to be left alone."
Sarasti steepled his fingers and turned his face in her direction. "That your recommendation?"
She wished it was. "No, sir. I'm just saying that Burns-Caulfield took a lot of resources and effort to
set up. Whoever built it obviously values their anonymity and has the technology to protect it."
The ball bounced one last time and wobbled back towards the Commons. Bates half-hopped from her
seat (she floated briefly), ^Page-59

[[Chapter-4#^Page-60]] 
barely catching it on its way past. There remained a new-born-animal
awkwardness to her movements, half Coriolis, half residual rigor. Still: a big improvement in four
hours. The rest of the Humans were barely past the walking stage.
"Maybe it wasn't much trouble for them at all, eh?" Szpindel was musing. "Maybe it was dead easy."
"In which case they might or might not be as xenophobic, but they're even more advanced. We don't
want to rush into this."
Sarasti turned back to the simmering graphics. "So?"
Bates kneaded the recovered ball with her fingertips. "The second mouse gets the cheese. We may
have blown our top-of-the-line recon in the Kuiper, but we don't have to go in blind. Send in our own
drones along separate vectors. Hold off on a close approach until we at least know whether we're
dealing with friendlies or hostiles."
James shook her head. "If they were hostile, they could have packed the Fireflies with antimatter. Or
sent one big object instead of sixty thousand little ones, let the impact take us out."
"The Fireflies only imply an initial curiosity," Bates said. "Who knows if they liked what they saw?"
"What if this whole diversion theory's just so much shit?"
I turned, briefly startled. James's mouth had made the words; Sascha had spoken them.
"You wanna stay hidden, you don't light up the sky with fucking fireworks," she continued. "You don't
need a diversion if nobody's looking for you, and nobody's looking for you if you lie low. If they were
so curious, they could've just snuck in a spycam."
"Risks detection," the vampire said mildly.
"Hate to break it, Jukka, but the Fireflies didn't exactly slip under the rad—"
Sarasti opened his mouth, closed it again. Filed teeth, briefly visible, clicked audibly behind his face.
Tabletop graphics reflected off his visor, a band of writhing polychrome distortions where eyes should
be. ^Page-60

[[Chapter-4#^Page-61]] 
Sascha shut up.
Sarasti continued. "They trade stealth for speed. By the time you react, they already have what they
want." He spoke quietly, patiently, a well-fed predator explaining the rules of the game to prey that
really should know better: the longer it takes me to track you down, the more hope you have of
escaping.
But Sascha had already fled. Her surfaces had scattered like a flock of panicked starlings, and the next
time Susan James' mouth opened, it was Susan James who spoke through it. "Sascha's aware of the
current paradigm, Jukka. She's simply worried that it might be wrong."
"Got another we could trade it on?" Szpindel wondered. "More options? Longer warranty?"
"I don't know." James sighed. "I guess not. It's just—odd, that they'd want to actively mislead us. I'd
hoped they were merely— well." She spread her hands. "Probably no big deal. I'm sure they'll still be
willing to talk, if we handle the introductions right. We just need to be a little more cautious,
perhaps..."
Sarasti unfolded himself from his chair and loomed over us. "We go in. What we know weighs against
further delay."
Bates frowned and pitched her ball back into orbit. "Sir, all we actually know is that an Oasa emitter's
in our path. We don't even know if there's anyone there."
"There is," Sarasti said. "They expect us."
Nobody spoke for a few seconds. Someone's joints cracked in the silence.
"Er..." Szpindel began.
Without looking, Sarasti flicked out his arm and snatched Bates' returning ball from the air. "Ladar
pings Theseus four hours forty-eight minutes ago. We respond with an identical signal. Nothing. Probe
launches half-hour before we wake up. We don't go in blind, but we don't wait. They see us already.
Longer we wait, greater risk of countermeasures." ^Page-61

[[Chapter-4#^Page-62]] 
I looked at the dark featureless placeholder on the table: bigger than Jupiter and we couldn't even see
it yet. Something in the shadow of that mass had just reached out with casual, unimaginable precision
and tapped us on the nose with a laser beam.
This was not going to be an even match.
Szpindel spoke for all of us: "You knew that all along? You're telling us now?"
This time Sarasti's smile was wide and toothy. It was as though a gash had opened in the lower half of
his face.
Maybe it was a predator thing. He just couldn't help playing with his food.
It wasn't so much the way they looked. The elongate limbs, the pale skin, the canines and the extended
mandible—noticeable, yes, even alien, but not disturbing, not frightening. Not even the eyes, really.
The eyes of dogs and cats shine in the darkness; we don't shiver at the sight.
Not the way they looked. The way they moved.
Something in the reflexes, maybe. The way they held their limbs: like mantis limbs, long jointed
things you just knew could reach out and snatch you from right across the room, any time they felt like
it. When Sarasti looked at me—really looked, naked-eyed, unfiltered by the visor— a half-million
years just melted away. The fact that he was extinct meant nothing. The fact that we'd come so far,
grown strong enough to resurrect our own nightmares to serve us...meant nothing. The genes aren't
fooled. They know what to fear.
Of course, you had to experience it in person. Robert Paglini knew the theory of vampires down the
molecules, but even with all those technical specs in his head he never really got it.
He called me, before we left. I hadn't been expecting it; ever since the roster had been announced our
watches had blocked calls ^Page-62

[[Chapter-4#^Page-63]] 
from anyone not explicitly contact-listed. I'd forgotten that Pag had been.
We hadn't spoken since Chelsea. I'd given up on ever hearing from him again.
But there he was. "Pod-man." He smiled, a tentative overture.
"It's good to see you," I said, because that's what people said in similar situations.
"Yeah, well I saw your name in the noose. You've made it big, for a baseline."
"Not so big."
"Crap. You're the vanguard of the Human Race. You're our first, last, and only hope against the
unknown. Man, you showed them." He held his fist up and shook it, vicariously triumphant.
Showing them had become a cornerstone of Robert Paglino's life. He'd really made it work for him,
too, overcome the handicap of a natural birth with retrofits and enhancements and sheer bloody-
mindedness. In a world in which Humanity had become redundant in unprecedented numbers, we'd
both retained the status of another age: working professional.
"So you're taking orders from a vamp," he said now. "Talk about fighting fire with fire."
"I guess it's practice. Until we run up against the real thing."
He laughed. I couldn't imagine why. But I smiled back anyway.
It was good to see him.
"So, what are they like?" Pag asked.
"Vampires? I don't know. Just met my first one yesterday."
"And?"
"Hard to read. Didn't even seem to be aware of his surroundings sometimes, he seemed to be... off in
his own little world."
"He's aware all right. Those things are so fast it's scary. You know they can hold both aspects of a
Necker cube in their heads at the same time?"
The term rang a bell. I subtitled, and saw the thumbnail of a familiar wireframe box: ^Page-63

[[Chapter-4#^Page-64]] 
Now I remembered: classic ambiguous illusion. Sometimes the shaded panel seemed to be in front,
sometimes behind. The perspective flipped back and forth as you watched.
"You or I, we can only see it one way or the other," Pag was saying. "Vamps see it both ways at once.
Do you have any idea what kind of an edge that gives 'em?"
"Not enough of one."
"Touché. But hey, not their fault neutral traits get fixed in small populations."
"I don't know if I'd call the Crucifix glitch neutral."
"It was at first. How many intersecting right angles do you see in nature?" He waved one dismissive
hand. "Anyway, that's not the point. The point is they can do something that's neurologically
impossible for us Humans. They can hold simultaneous multiple worldviews, Pod-man. They just see
things we have to work out step-by-step, they don't have to think about it. You know, there isn't a
single baseline human who could just tell you, just off the top of their heads, every prime number
between one and a billion? In the old days, only a few autistics could do shit like that."
"He never uses the past tense," I murmered.
"Huh? Oh, that." Pag nodded. "They never experience the past tense. It's just another thread to them.
They don't remember stuff, they relive it."
"What, like a post-traumatic flashback?"
"Not so traumatic." He grimaced. "Not for them, at least."
"So this is obviously your current hot spot? Vampires?" ^Page-64

[[Chapter-4#^Page-65]] 
"Pod, vampires are the capital-Hot spot for anyone with a 'neuro' in their c.v. I'm just doing a couple
of histology papers. Pattern-matching receptors, Mexican-hat arrays, reward/irrelevance filters. The
eyes, basically."
"Right." I hesitated. "Those kind of throw you."
"No shit." Pag nodded knowingly. "That tap lucidum of theirs, that shine. Scary." He shook his head,
impressed all over again at the recollection.
"You've never met one," I surmised.
"What, in the flesh? I'd give my left ball. Why?"
"It's not the shine. It's the—" I groped for a word that fit— "The attitude, maybe."
"Yeah," he said after a bit. "I guess sometimes you've just gotta be there, huh? Which is why I envy
you, Pod-man."
"You shouldn't."
"I should. Even if you never meet whoever sent the 'Flies, you're in for one Christly research
opportunity with that—Sarasti, is it?"
"Wasted on me. The only neuro in my file's under medical history."
He laughed. "Anyway, like I said, I just saw your name in the headlines and I figured, hey, the man's
leaving in a couple of months, I should probably stop waiting around for him to call."
It had been over two years. "I didn't think I'd get through. I thought you'd shitlisted me."
"Nah. Never." He looked down, though, and fell silent.
"But you should have called her," he said at last.
"I know."
"She was dying. You should've—"
"There wasn't time."
He let the lie sit there for a while.
"Anyway," he said at last. "I just wanted to wish you luck." Which wasn't exactly true either.
"Thanks. I appreciate that." ^Page-65

[[Chapter-4#^Page-66]] 
"Kick their alien asses. If aliens have asses."
"There's five of us, Pag. Nine if you count the backups. We're not exactly an army."
"Just an expression, fellow mammal. Bury the hatchet. Damn the torpedoes. Soothe the serpent."
Raise the white flag, I thought.
"I guess you're busy," he said, "I'll—"
"Look, you want to get together? In airspace? I haven't been to QuBit's in a while."
"Love to, Pod. Unfortunately I'm in Mankoya. Splice'n'dice workshop."
"What, you mean physically?"
"Cutting-edge research. Old-school habits."
"Too bad."
"Anyway, I'll let you go. Just wanted, you know—"
"Thanks," I said again.
"So, you know. Bye," Robert Paglino told me. Which was, when you got down to it, the reason he'd
called.
He wasn't expecting another chance.
Pag blamed me for the way it had ended with Chelsea. Fair enough. I blamed him for the way it began.
He'd gone into neuroeconomics at least partly because his childhood buddy had turned into a pod
person before his eyes. I'd ended up in Synthesis for roughly the same reason. Our paths had diverged,
and we didn't see each other in the flesh all that often; but two decades after I'd brutalized a handful of
children on his behalf, Robert Paglino was still my best and only friend.
"You need to seriously thaw out," he told me, "And I know just the lady to handle the oven mitts."
"That is perhaps the worst use of metaphor in the history of human language," I said. ^Page-66

[[Chapter-4#^Page-67]] 
"Seriously, Pod. She'll be good for you. A, a counterbalance—ease you a bit closer to the comfy mean,
you know?"
"No, Pag, I don't. What is she, another neuroeconomist?"
"Neuroaestheticist," he said.
"There's still a market for those?" I couldn't imagine how; why pay to tweak your compatibility with
some significant other, when significant others themselves were so out of fashion?
"Not much of one," Pag admitted. "Fact is, she's pretty much retired. But she's still got the tools, my
man. Very thigmotactic. Likes all her relationships face-to-face and in the flesh."
"I dunno, Pag. Sounds like work."
"Not like your work. She's got to be easier than the bleeding composites you front for. She's smart,
she's sexy, and she's nicely inside the standard deev except for the personal contact thing. Which is not
so much outright perversion as charming fetish. In your case it could even be therapeutic."
"If I wanted therapy I'd see a therapist."
"She does a bit of that too, actually."
"Yeah?" And then, despite myself, "Any good?"
He looked me up and down. "No one's that good. That's not what this is. I just figured you two would
click. Chelse is one of the few who might not be completely put off by your intimacy issues."
"Everyone's got intimacy issues these days, in case you hadn't noticed." He must have; the population
had been dropping for decades.
"I was being euphemistic. I meant your aversion to general Human contact."
"Making it euphemistic to call you Human?"
He grinned. "Different deal. We got history."
"No thanks."
"Too late. She's already en route to the appointed place."
"Appoin—you're an asshole, Pag."
"The tightest." ^Page-67

[[Chapter-4#^Page-68]] 
Which was how I found myself intrusively face-to-face in an airspace lounge south of Beth and Bear.
The lighting was low and indirect, creeping from under seats and the edges of tables; the chromatics,
this afternoon at least, were defiantly longwave. It was a place where baselines could pretend to see in
infrared.
So I pretended for a moment, assessing the woman in the corner booth: gangly and glorious, half-a-
dozen ethnicities coexisting peacefully with no single voice dominant. Something glowed on her
cheek, a faint emerald staccato against the ambient red shift. Her hair floated in a diffuse ebony cloud
about her head; as I neared I caught occasional glints of metal within that nimbus, the threads of a
static generator purveying the illusion of weightlessness. In normal light her blood-red skin would
doubtless shift down to the fashionable butterscotch of the unrepentant mongrel.
She was attractive, but so was everyone in this kind of light; the longer the wavelength, the softer the
focus. There's a reason fuckcubbies don't come with fluorescent lights.
You will not fall for this, I told myself.
"Chelsea," she said. Her little finger rested on one of the table's inset trickle-chargers. "Former
neuroaestheticist, presently a parasite on the Body Economic thanks to genes and machines on the
cutting edge."
The glow on her cheek flapped bright lazy wings: a tattoo, a bioluminescent butterfly.
"Siri," I said. "Freelance synthesist, indentured servant to the genes and machines that turned you into
a parasite."
She waved at the empty seat. I took it, assessing the system before me, sizing up the best approach for
a fast yet diplomatic disconnect. The set of her shoulders told me she enjoyed lightscapes, and was
embarrassed to admit it. Monahan was her favorite artist.  thought herself a natural girl because
she'd stayed on chemical libidinals all these years, even though a synaptic edit would have been
simpler. She revelled in her own inconsistency: a woman whose ^Page-68

[[Chapter-4#^Page-69]] 
professional machinery edited
thought itself, yet mistrustful of the dehumanising impact of telephonShees. Innately affectionate, and
innately afraid of unreturned affection, and indomitably unwilling to let any of that stop her.
She liked what she saw when looked at me. She was a little afraid of that, too.
Chelsea gestured at my side of the table. The touchpads there glowed soft, dissonant sapphire in the
bloody light, like a set of splayed fingerprints. "Good dope here. Extra hydroxyl on the ring, or
something."
Assembly-line neuropharm doesn't do much for me; it's optimized for people with more meat in their
heads. I fingered one of the pads for appearances, and barely felt the tingle.
"So. A Synthesist. Explaining the Incomprehensible to the Indifferent."
I smiled on cue. "More like bridging the gap between the people who make the breakthroughs and the
people who take the credit for them."
She smiled back. "So how do you do it? All those optimized frontal lobes and refits—I mean, if
they're incomprehensible, how do you comprehend them?"
"It helps to find pretty much everyone else incomprehensible too. Provides experience." There. That
should force a bit of distance.
It didn't. She thought I was joking. I could see her lining up to push for more details, to ask questions
about what I did, which would lead to questions about me, which would lead—
"Tell me what it's like," I said smoothly, "rewiring people's heads for a living."
Chelsea grimaced; the butterfly on her cheek fluttered nervously at the motion, wings brightening.
"God, you make it sound like we turn them into zombies or something. They're just tweaks, mainly.
Changing taste in music or cuisine, you know, optimizing mate compatibility. It's all completely
reversible." ^Page-69

[[Chapter-4#^Page-70]] 
"There aren't drugs for that?"
"Nah. Too much developmental variation between brains; our targeting is really fine-scale. But it's not
all microsurgery and fried synapses, you know. You'd be surprised how much rewiring can be done
noninvasively. You can start all sorts of cascades just by playing certain sounds in the right order, or
showing images with the right balance of geometry and emotion."
"I assume those are new techniques."
"Not really. Rhythm and music hang their hats on the same basic principle. We just turned art into
science."
"Yeah, but when?" The recent past, certainly. Sometime within the past twenty years or so—
Her voice grew suddenly quiet. "Robert told me about your operation. Some kind of viral epilepsy,
right? Back when you were just a tyke."
I'd never explicitly asked him to keep it a secret. What was the difference anyway? I'd made a full
recovery.
Besides, Pag still thought that had happened to someone else.
"I don't know your specifics," Chelsea continued gently. "But from the sound of it, noninvasive
techniques wouldn't have helped. I'm sure they only did what they had to."
I tried to suppress the thought, and couldn't: I like this woman.
I felt something then, a strange, unfamiliar sensation that somehow loosened my vertebrae. The chair
felt subtly, indefinably more comfortable at my back.
"Anyway." My silence had thrown her off-stride. "Haven't done it much since the bottom dropped out
of the market. But it did leave me with a fondness for face-to-face encounters, if you know what I
mean."
"Yeah. Pag said you took your sex in the first-person."
She nodded. "I'm very old-school. You okay with that?"
I wasn't certain. I was a virgin in the real world, one of the few things I still had in common with the
rest of civilized society. ^Page-70

[[Chapter-4#^Page-71]] 
"In principle, I guess. It just seems—a lot of effort for not as much payoff,
you know?"
"Don't I." She smiled. "Real fuckbuddies aren't airbrushed. Got all these needs and demands that you
can't edit out. How can you blame anyone for saying no thanks to all that, now there's a choice? You
gotta wonder how our parents ever stayed together sometimes."
You gotta wonder why they did. I felt myself sinking deeper into the chair, wondered again at this
strange new sensation. Chelsea had said the dopamine was tweaked. That was probably it.
She leaned forward, not coy, not coquettish, not breaking eye contact for an instant in the longwave
gloom. I could smell the lemony tang of pheromones and synthetics mingling on her skin. "But there
are advantages too, once you learn the moves," she said. "The body's got a long memory. And you do
realize that there's no trickler under your left finger there, don't you, Siri?"
I looked. My left arm was slightly extended, index finger touching one of the trickle pads; and my
right had mirrored the motion while I wasn't watching, its own finger tapping uselessly on blank
tabletop.
I pulled it back. "Bit of a bilateral twitch," I admitted. "The body creeps into symmetrical poses when
I'm not looking."
I waited for a joke, or at least a raised eyebrow. Chelsea just nodded and resumed her thread. "So if
you're game for this, so am I. I've never been entangled with a synthesist before."
"Jargonaut's fine. I'm not proud."
"Don't you just always know just exactly what to say." She cocked her head at me. "So, your name.
What's it mean?"
Relaxed. That was it. I felt relaxed.
"I don't know. It's just a name."
"Well, it's not good enough. If we're gonna to be swapping spit for any length of time you've gotta get
a name that means something."
And we were, I realized. Chelsea had decided while I wasn't looking. I could have stopped her right

"I think I'll call you Cygnus," Chelsea said.
"The swan?" I said. A bit precious, but it could have been worse.
She shook her head. "Black hole. Cygnus X-1."
I furrowed my brow at her, but I knew exactly what she meant: a dark, dense object that sucks up the
light and destroys everything in its path.
"Thanks a whole fucking lot. Why?"
"I'm not sure. Something dark about you." She shrugged, and gave me a great toothy grin. "But it's not
unattractive. And let me give you a tweak or two, I bet you'd grow right out of it."
Pag admitted afterward, a bit sheepishly, that maybe I should have read that as a warning sign. Live
and learn. ^Page-72
