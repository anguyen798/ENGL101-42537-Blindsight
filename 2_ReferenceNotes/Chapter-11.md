"Predators run for their dinner. Prey run for their lives."
—Old Ecologist's Proverb
We were blind and helpless, jammed into a fragile bubble behind enemy lines. But finally the
whisperers were silent. The monsters had stayed beyond the covers.
And Amanda Bates was out there with them.
"What the fuck," Szpindel breathed.
The eyes behind his faceplate were active and searching. "You can see?" I asked.
He nodded. "What happened to Bates? Her suit breach?"
"I don't think so."
"Then why'd she say she was dead? What—"
"She meant it literally," I told him. "Not I'm as good as dead or I'm going to die. She meant dead now.
Like she was a talking corpse."
"How do—" you know? Stupid question. His face ticced and trembled in the helmet. "That's crazy,
eh?"
"Define crazy."
The Gang floated quietly, cheek-to-jowl behind Szpindel in the cramped enclosure. Cruncher had
stopped obsessing about the leg as soon as we'd sealed up. Or maybe he'd simply been overridden; I
thought I saw facets of Susan in the twitching of those thick gloved fingers.
Szpindel's breath echoed second-hand over the link. "If Bates is dead, then so are we."
"Maybe not. We wait out the spike, we get out of here. Besides," I added, "she wasn't dead. She only
said she was."
"Fuck," Szpindel reached out and pressed his gloved palm against the skin of the tent. He felt back and
forth along the fabric. "Someone did put out a transducer—"
"Eight o'clock," I said. "About a meter." Szpindel's hand came to rest across the wall from the pod. My
HUD flooded with second-hand numbers, vibrated down his arm and relayed to our suits.
Still five Tesla out there. Falling, though. The tent expanded around us as if breathing, shrank back in
the next second as some transient low-pressure front moved past.
"When did your sight come back?" I wondered.
"Soon as we came inside."
"Sooner. You saw the battery."
"Fumbled it." He grunted. "Not that I'm much less of a spaz even when I'm not blind, eh? Bates! You
out there?"
"You reached for it. You almost caught it. That wasn't blind chance."
"Not blind chance. Blindsight. Amanda? Respond, please."
"Blindsight?"
"Nothing wrong with the receptors," he said distractedly. "Brain processes the image but it can't access
it. Brain stem takes over."
"Your brainstem can see but you can't?"
"Something like that. Shut up and let me—Amanda, can you hear me?"
"...No..."
Not from anyone in the tent, that voice. It had shivered down Szpindel's arm, barely audible, with the
rest of the data. From outside.
"Major Mandy!" Szpindel exclaimed. "You're alive!"
"....no..." A whisper like white noise.
"Well you're talking to us, so you sure as shit ain't dead."
"No..."
Szpindel and I exchanged looks. "What's the problem, Major?"
Silence. The Gang bumped gently against the wall behind us, all facets opaque.
"Major Bates? Can you hear me?"
"No." It was a dead voice— sedated, trapped in a fishbowl, transmitted through limbs and lead at a
three-digit baud rate. But it was definitely Bates' voice.
"Major, you've got to get in here," Szpindel said. "Can you come inside?"
"...No...".
"Are you injured? Are you pinned by something?"
"..N—no."
Maybe not her voice, after all. Maybe just her vocal cords.
"Look. Amanda, it's dangerous. It's too damn hot out there, do you understand? You—"
"I'm not out here," said the voice.
"Where are you?"
"...nowhere."
I looked at Szpindel. Szpindel looked at me. Neither of us spoke.
James did. At long last, and softly: "And what are you, Amanda?"
No answer.
"Are you Rorschach?"
Here in the belly of the beast, it was so easy to believe.
"No..."
"Then what?"
"N...nothing." The voice was flat and mechanical. "I'm nothing."
"You're saying you don't exist?" Szpindel said slowly.
"Yes."
The tent breathed around us.
"Then how can you speak?" Susan asked the voice. "If you don't exist, what are we talking to?"
"Something...else." A sigh. A breath of static. "Not me."
"Shit," Szpindel muttered. His surfaces brightened with resolve and sudden insight. He pulled his hand
from the wall; my HUD thinned instantly. "Her brain's frying. We gotta get her inside." He reached for
the release.
I put out my own hand. "The spike—"
"Crested already, commissar. We're past the worst of it."
"Are you saying it's safe?"
"It's lethal. It's always lethal, and she's out there in it, and she could do some serious damage to
herself in her pres—"
Something bumped the tent from the outside. Something grabbed the outer catch and pulled.
Our shelter opened like an eye. Amanda Bates looked in at us through the exposed membrane. "I'm
reading three point eight," she said. "That's tolerable, right?"
Nobody moved.
"Come on, people. Break's over."
"Ama—" Szpindel stared. "Are you okay?"
"In here? Not likely. But we've got a job to do."
"Do you—exist?" I asked.
"What kind of stupid question is that? Szpindel, how's this field strength? Can we work in it?"
"Uh..." He swallowed audibly. "Maybe we should abort, Major. That spike was—"
"According to my readings, the spike is pretty much over. And we've got less than two hours to finish
setting up, run our ground truths, and get out of here. Can we do that without hallucinating?"
"I don't think we'll shake the heebie-jeebies," Szpindel admitted. "But we shouldn't have to worry
about —extreme effects— until another spike hits."
"Good."
"Which could be any time."
"We weren't hallucinating," James said quietly.
"We can discuss it later," Bates said. "Now—"
"There was a pattern there," James insisted. "In the fields. In my head. Rorschach was talking. Maybe
not to us, but it was talking."
"Good." Bates pushed herself back to let us pass. "Maybe now we can finally learn to talk back."
"Maybe we can learn to listen," James said.
*
We fled like frightened children with brave faces. We left a base camp behind: Jack, still miraculously
functional in its vestibule; a tunnel into the haunted mansion; forlorn magnetometers left to die in the
faint hope they might not. Crude pyronometers and thermographs, antique radiation-proof devices that
measured the world through the flex and stretch of metal tabs and etched their findings on rolls of
plastic. Glow-globes and diving bells and guide ropes strung one to another. We left it all behind, and
promised to return in thirty-six hours if we lived so long.
Inside each of us, infinitesimal lacerations were turning our cells to mush. Plasma membranes sprang
countless leaks. Overwhelmed repair enzymes clung desperately to shredded genes and barely delayed
the inevitable. Anxious to avoid the rush, patches of my intestinal lining began flaking away before
the rest of the body had a chance to die.
By the time we docked with Theseus both Michelle and I were feeling nauseous. (The rest of the Gang,
oddly, was not; I had no idea how that was possible.) The others would be presenting the same
symptoms within minutes. Without intervention we would all be vomiting our guts out for the
following two days. Then the body would pretend to recover; for perhaps a week we would feel no
pain and have no future. We would walk and talk and move like any living thing, and perhaps
convince ourselves that we were immortal after all.
Then we would collapse into ourselves, rotted from the inside out. We would bleed from our eyes and
mouths and assholes, and if any God was merciful we would die before splitting open like rotten fruit.
But of course Theseus, our redeemer, would save us from such a fate. We filed from the shuttle into a
great balloon that Sarasti had erected to capture our personal effects; we shed our contaminated space
suits and clothing and emerged naked into the spine. We passed single-file through the drum, the
Flying Dead in formation. Jukka Sarasti—discreetly distant on the turning floor—leapt up in our wake
and disappeared aft, to feed our radioactive cast-offs into the decompiler.
Into the crypt. Our coffins lay open across the rear bulkhead. We sank gratefully and wordlessly into
their embrace. Bates coughed blood as the lids came down.
My bones hummed as the Captain began to shut me off. I went to sleep a dead man. I had only theory
and the assurances of fellow machinery that I would ever be born again.
*
Keeton, come forth.
I woke up ravenous. Faint voices drifted forward from the drum. I floated in my pod for a few
moments, eyes closed, savoring absences: no pain, no nausea. No terrifying subliminal sense of one's
own body sloughing incrementally to mush. Weakness, and hunger; otherwise I felt fine.
I opened my eyes.
Something like an arm. Grey and glistening, far too— too attenuate to be human. No hand at its tip.
Too many joints, a limb broken in a dozen places. It extended from a body barely visible over the lip
of the pod, a suggestion of dark bulk and other limbs in disjoint motion. It hovered motionless before
me, as if startled in the midst of some shameful act.
By the time I had breath enough to cry out, it had whipped back out of sight.
I erupted from the pod, eyes everywhere. Now they saw nothing: an empty crypt, a naked note-taker.
The mirrored bulkhead reflected vacant pods to either side. I called up ConSensus: all systems
nominal.
It didn't reflect, I remembered. The mirror didn't show it.
I headed aft, heart still pounding. The drum opened around me, Szpindel and the Gang conversing in
low tones aft. Szpindel glanced up and waved a trembling hand in greeting.
"You need to check me out," I called. My voice wasn't nearly so steady as I'd hoped.
"Admitting you have a problem is the first step," Szpindel called back. "Just don't expect miracles."
He turned back to the Gang; James on top, they sat in a diagnostic couch staring at some test pattern
shimmering on the rear bulkhead.
I grabbed the tip of a stairway and pulled myself down. Coriolis pushed me sideways like a flag in the
breeze. "I'm either hallucinating or there's something on board."
"You're hallucinating."
"I'm serious."
"So am I. Take a number. Wait your turn."
He was serious. Once I forced myself to calm down and read the signs, I could see he wasn't even
surprised.
"Guess you're pretty hungry after all that exhausting lying around, eh?" Szpindel waved at the galley.
"Eat something. Be with you in a few minutes."
I forced myself to work up my latest synopsis while I ate, but that only took half a mind; the other still
shivered in residual thrall to fight-flight. I tried to distract it by tapping the BioMed feed.
"It was real," James was saying. "We all saw it."
No. Couldn't have been.
Szpindel cleared his throat. "Try this one."
The feed showed what she saw: a small black triangle on a white background. In the next instant it
shattered into a dozen identical copies, and a dozen dozen. The proliferating brood rotated around the
center screen, geometric primitives ballroom-dancing in precise formation, each sprouting smaller
triangles from its tips, fractalizing, rotating, evolving into an infinite, intricate tilework...
A sketchpad, I realized. An interactive eyewitness reconstruction, without the verbiage. Susan's own
pattern-matching wetware reacted to what she saw— no, there were more of them; no, the
orientation's wrong; yes, that's it, but bigger— and Szpindel's machine picked those reactions right
out of her head and amended the display in realtime. It was a big step up from that half-assed
workaround called language. The easily-impressed might have even called it mind-reading.
It wasn't, though. It was all just feedback and correlation. It doesn't take a telepath to turn one set of
patterns into another. Fortunately.
"That's it! That's it!" Susan cried.
The triangles had iterated out of existence. Now the display was full of interlocking asymmetrical
pentagrams, a spiderweb of fish scales.
"Don't tell us that's random noise," she said triumphantly.
"No," Szpindel said, "It's a Klüver constant."
"A—"
"It's a hallucination, Suze."
"Of course. But something planted it in our head, right? And—"
"It was in your head all along. It was in your head the day you were born."
"No."
"It's an artefact of deep brain structure. Even congenitally blind people see them sometimes."
"None of us have seen them before. Ever."
"I believe you. But there's no information there, eh? That wasn't Rorschach talking, it was just—
interference. Like everything else."
"But it was so vivid! Not that flickering corner-of-your-eye stuff we saw everywhere. This was solid.
It was realer than real."
"That's how you can tell it wasn't. Since you don't actually see it, there's no messy eyeball optics to
limit resolution."
"Oh," James said, and then, softly: "Shit."
"Yeah. Sorry." And then, "Any time you're ready."
I looked up; Szpindel was waving me over. James rose from her chair, but it was Michelle who gave
him a quick disconsolate squeeze and Sascha who grumbled past me on her way to their tent.
By the time I reached him Szpindel had unfolded the couch into a half-cot. "Lie down."
I did. "I wasn't talking about back in Rorschach, you know. I meant here. I saw something right now.
When I woke up."
"Raise your left hand," he said. Then: "Just your left, eh?"
I lowered my right, winced at the pinprick. "That's a bit primitive."
He eyed the blood-filled cuvette between his thumb and forefinger: a shivering ruby teardrop the size
of a fingernail. "Wet sample's still best for some things."
"Aren't the pods supposed to do everything?"
Szpindel nodded. "Call it a quality-control test. Keep the ship on its toes." He dropped the sample onto
the nearest countertop. The teardrop flattened and burst; the surface drank my blood as if parched.
Szpindel smacked his lips. "Elevated cholinesterase inhibitors in the ret. Yum."
For all I knew, my blood results actually did taste good to the man. Szpindel didn't just read results; he
felt them, smelled and saw and experienced each datum like drops of citrus on the tongue. The whole
BioMed subdrum was but a part of the Szpindel prosthesis: an extended body with dozens of different
sensory modes, forced to talk to a brain that knew only five.
No wonder he'd bonded with Michelle. He was almost synesthesiac himself.
"You spent a bit longer in there than the rest of us," he remarked.
"That's significant?"
A jerking shrug. "Maybe your organs got a bit more cooked than ours. Maybe you just got a delicate
constitution. Your pod would've caught anything—imminent, so I figure—ah."
"What?"
"Some cells along your brainpan going into overdrive. More in your bladder and kidney."
"Tumors?"
"What you expect? Rorschach's no rejuve spa."
"But the pod—"
Szpindel grimaced; his idea of a reassuring smile. "Repairs ninety-nine point nine percent of the
damage, sure. By the time you get to the last zero-point-one, you're into diminishing returns. These're
small, commissar. Chances are your own body'll take care of 'em. If not, we know where they live."
"The ones in my brain. Could they be causing—"
"Not a chance." He chewed on his lower lip for a moment. "Course, cancer's not all that thing did to
us."
"What I saw. Up in the crypt. It had these multijointed arms from a central mass. Big as a person,
maybe."
Szpindel nodded. "Get used to it."
"The others are seeing these things?"
"I doubt it. Everyone has a different take, like—" his twitching face conveyed Dare I say it?
"—Rorschach blots."
"I was expecting hallucinations in the field," I admitted, "but up here?"
"TMS effects—" Szpindel snapped his fingers— "they're sticky, eh? Neurons get kicked into one state,
take a while to come unstuck. You never got a TAT? Well-adjusted boy like you?"
"Once or twice," I said. "Maybe."
"Same principle."
"So I'm going to keep seeing this stuff."
"Party line is they fade over time. Week or two you're back to normal. But out here, with that thing..."
He shrugged. "Too many variables. Not the least of which is, I assume we'll keep going back until
Sarasti says otherwise."
"But they're basically magnetic effects."
"Probably. Although I'm not betting on anything where that fucker's concerned."
"Could something else be causing them?" I asked. "Something on this ship?"
"Like what?'
"I don't know. Leakage in Theseus' magnetic shielding, maybe."
"Not normally. Course, we've all got little implanted networks in our heads, eh? And you've got a
whole hemisphere of prosthetics up there, who knows what kind of side-effects those might let you in
for. Why? Rorschach not a good enough reason for you?"
I saw them before, I might have said.
And then Szpindel would say Oh, when? Where?
And maybe I'd reply When I was spying on your private life, and any chance of noninvasive
observation would be flushed down to the atoms.
"It's probably nothing. I've just been—jumpy lately. Thought I saw something weird in the spinal
bundle, back before we landed on Rorschach. Just for a second, you know, and it disappeared as soon
as I focused on it."
"Multijointed arms with a central mass?"
"God no. Just a flicker, really. If it was anything at all, it was probably just Amanda's rubber ball
floating around up there."
"Probably." Szpindel seemed almost amused. "Couldn't hurt to check for leakage in the shielding,
though. Just in case. Not like we need something else making us see things, eh?"
I shook my head at remembered nightmares. "How are the others?"
"Gang's fine, if a bit disappointed. Haven't seen the Major." He shrugged. "Maybe she's avoiding me."
"It hit her pretty hard."
"No worse than the rest of us, really. She might not even remember it."
"How—how could she possibly believe she didn't even exist?"
Szpindel shook his head. "Didn't believe it. Knew it. For a fact."
"But how—"
"Charge gauge on your car, right? Sometimes the contacts corrode. Readout freezes on empty, so you
think it's empty. What else you supposed to think? Not like you can go in and count the electrons."
"You're saying the brain's got some kind of existence gauge?"
"Brain's got all kinds of gauges. You can know you're blind even when you're not; you can know you
can see, even when you're blind. And yeah, you can know you don't exist even when you do. It's a long
list, commissar. Cotard's, Anton's, Damascus Disease. Just for starters."
He hadn't said blindsight.
"What was it like?" I asked.
"Like?" Although he knew exactly what I meant.
"Did your arm— move by itself? When it reached for that battery?"
"Oh. Nah. You're still in control, you just—you get a feeling, is all. A sense of where to reach. One
part of the brain playing charades with another, eh?" He gestured at the couch. "Get off. Seen enough
of your ugly guts for now. And send up Bates if you can find where she's hiding. Probably back at Fab
building a bigger army."
The misgivings glinted off him like sunlight. "You have a problem with her," I said.
He started to deny it, then remembered who he was talking to. "Not personally. Just—human node
running mechanical infantry. Electronic reflexes slaved to meat reflexes. You tell me where the weak
spot is."
"Down in Rorschach, I'd have to say all the links are pretty weak."
"Not talking about Rorschach," Szpindel said. "We go there. What stops them from coming here?"
"Them."
"Maybe they haven't arrived yet," he admitted. "But when they do, I'm betting we'll be going up
against something bigger than anaerobic microbes." When I didn't answer he continued, his voice
lowered. "And anyway, Mission Control didn't know shit about Rorschach. They thought they were
sending us some place where drones could do all the heavy lifting. But they just hate not being in
command, eh? Can't admit the grunts're smarter than the generals. So our defenses get compromised
for political appearances—not like that's any kinda news—and I'm no jarhead but it strikes me as real
bad strategy."
I remembered Amanda Bates, midwifing the birth of her troops. I'm more of a safety precaution....
"Amanda—" I began.
"Like Mandy fine. Nice mammal. But if we're cruising into a combat situation I don't want my ass
covered by some network held back by its weakest link."
"If you're going to be surrounded by a swarm of killer robots, maybe—"
"Yeah, people keep saying that. Can't trust the machines. Luddites love to go on about computer
malfunctions, and how many accidental wars we might have prevented because a human had the final
say. But funny thing, commissar; nobody talks about how many intentional wars got started for the
same reason. You're still writing those postcards to posterity?"
I nodded, and didn't wince inwardly. It was just Szpindel.
"Well, feel free to stick this conversation in your next one. For all the good it'll do."
*
Imagine you are a prisoner of war.
You've got to admit you saw it coming. You've been crashing tech and seeding biosols for a solid
eighteen months; that's a good run by anyone's standards. Realist saboteurs do not, as a rule, enjoy
long careers. Everyone gets caught eventually.
It wasn't always thus. There was a day you might have even hoped for a peaceful retirement. But then
they brought the vampires back from the Pleistocene and Great Grieving Ganga did that ever turn the
balance of power upside down. Those fuckers are always ten steps ahead. It only makes sense; after
all, hunting people is what bloodsuckers evolved to do.
There's this line from an early pop-dyn textbook, really old, maybe even TwenCen. It's something of a
mantra—maybe prayer would be a better word—among those in your profession. Predators run for
their dinner, it goes. Prey run for their lives. The moral is supposed to be that on average, the hunted
escape the hunters because they're more motivated.
Maybe that was true when it all just came down to who ran faster. Doesn't seem to hold when the
strategy involves tactical foresight and double-reverse mind fucks, though. The vampires win every
time.
And now you're caught, and while it may have been vampires that set the trap, it was regular turncoat
baseline humans who pulled the trigger. For six hours now you've been geckoed to the wall of some
unnamed unlisted underground detention facility, watching as some of those selfsame humans played
games with your boyfriend and co-conspirator. These are not your average games. They involve pliers,
and glowing wires, and body parts that were not designed to detach. You wish, by now, that your lover
were dead, like the two others in your cell whose parts are scattered about the room. But they're not
letting that happen. They're having too much fun.
That's what it all comes down to. This is not an interrogation; there are less invasive ways to get more
reliable answers. These are simply a few more sadistic thugs with Authority, killing time and other
things, and you can only cry and squeeze your eyes tight and whimper like an animal even though they
haven't laid a hand on you yet. You can only wish they hadn't saved you for last, because you know
what that means.
But suddenly your tormentors stop in mid-game and cock their heads as if listening to some collective
inner voice. Presumably it tells them to take you off the wall, bring you into the next room, and sit you
down at one of two gel-padded chairs on opposite sides of a smart desk, because this is what they do—
far more gently than you'd expect—before retiring. You can also assume that whoever has given these
instructions is both powerful and displeased, because all the arrogant sadistic cockiness has drained
from their faces in the space of a heartbeat.
You sit and wait. The table glows with soft, cryptic symbols that would be of no earthly interest to you
even if you could understand them, even if they contained the very secret of the vampires themselves.
Some small part of you wonders if this latest development might be cause for hope; the rest of you
doesn't dare believe it. You hate yourself for caring about your own survival when chunks of your
friends and allies are still warm on the other side of the wall.
A stocky Amerind woman appears in the room with you, clad in nondescript military weave. Her hair
is buzzed short, her throat veined with the faint mesh of a sub-q antennae. Your brain stem sees that
she is ten meters tall, even though some impertinent gelatinous overlay insists that she is of only
average height.
The name tag on her left breast says Bates. You see no sign of rank.
Bates extracts a weapon from its sheath on her thigh. You flinch, but she does not point it at you. She
sets it on the desk, easily within your reach, and sits across from you.
A microwave pistol. Fully charged, unlocked. On its lowest setting it causes sunburn and nausea. On
its highest it flash-boils brains in the skull. At any setting between, it inflicts pain and injury in
increments as fine as your imagination.
Your imagination has been retooled for great sensitivity along such scales. You stare numbly at the
gun, trying to figure the trick.
"Two of your friends are dead," Bates says, as though you haven't just watched them die.
"Irrecoverably so."
Irrecoverably dead. Good one.
"We could reconstitute the bodies, but the brain damage..." Bates clears her throat as if uncomfortable,
as if embarrassed. It's a surprisingly human gesture for a monster. "We're trying to save the other one.
No promises.
"We need information," she says, cutting to the chase.
Of course. What came before was psychology, softening-up. Bates is the good cop.
"I've got nothing to tell you," you manage. It's ten percent defiance, ninety percent deduction: they
wouldn't have been able to catch you in the first place unless they already knew everything.
"Then we need an arrangement," Bates says. "We need to come to some kind of accommodation."
She has to be kidding.
Your incredulity must be showing. Bates addresses it: "I'm not completely unsympathetic. My gut
doesn't much like the idea of swapping reality for simulation, and it doesn't buy that what-is-truth spin
the Body Economic sells to get around it. Maybe there's reason to be scared. Not my problem, not my
job, just my opinion and it could be wrong. But if we kill each other in the meantime, we don't find out
either way. It's unproductive."
You see the dismembered bodies of your friends. You see pieces on the floor, still a little bit alive, and
this cunt has the nerve to talk about productivity?
"We didn't start it," you say.
"I don't know and I don't care. Like I said, it's not my job." Bates jerks a thumb over her shoulder at a
door in the wall behind her, the door she must have entered through. "In there," she says, "are the ones
who killed your friends. They've been disarmed. When you go through that door the room will go
offline and remain unmonitored for a period of sixty seconds. Nobody besides yourself will ever hold
you accountable for whatever happens in there during that time."
It's a trick. It has to be.
"What do you have to lose?" Bates wonders. "We can already do anything we want to you. It's not like
we need you to give us an excuse."
Hesitantly, you take the gun. Bates doesn't stop you.
She's right, you realize. You have absolutely nothing to lose. You stand and, suddenly fearless, point
the weapon at her face. "Why go in there? I can kill you right here."
She shrugs. "You could try. Waste of an opportunity, if you ask me."
"So I go in there, and I come out in sixty seconds, and then what?"
"Then we talk."
"We just—"
"Think of it as a gesture of good faith," she says. "Restitution, even."
The door opens at your approach, closes in your wake. And there they are, all four of them, spread up
across the wall like a chorus line of Christs on crosses. There's no gleam in those eyes now. There's
only a bright animal terror and the reflection of turned tables. Two of the Christs stain their pants
when you look them in the eye.
What's left? Maybe fifty seconds?
It's not a lot. You could have done so much more with just a little extra time. But it's enough, and you
don't want to impose on the good graces of this Bates woman.
Because she may at last be someone you can deal with.
*
Under other circumstances, Lieutenant Amanda Bates would have been court-martialed and executed
within the month. No matter that the four who'd died had been guilty of multiple counts of rape,
torture, and homicide; that's just what people did in wartime. It's what they'd always done. There was
nothing polite about war, no honorable code beyond the chain of command and the circling of wagons.
Deal with indiscretions if you must; punish the guilty if you have to, for appearance if nothing else.
But for God's sake close the doors first. Never give your enemy the satisfaction of seeing discord in
the ranks, show them nothing but unity and flinty-eyed resolve. There may be murderers and rapists in
our midst, but by God they're our murderers and rapists.
You certainly don't give right of revenge to some terrorist twat with over a hundred friendly scalps on
her belt.
Still, it was hard to argue with results: a negotiated ceasefire with the third-largest Realist franchise in
the hemisphere. An immediate forty-six percent decline in terrorist activities throughout the affected
territories. The unconditional cancellation of several in-progress campaigns which could have
seriously compromised three major catacombs and taken out the Duluth Staging Grounds entirely. All
because Lieutenant Amanda Bates, feeling her way through her first field command, had gambled on
empathy as a military strategy.
It was collaborating with the enemy, it was treason, it was betrayal of the rank and file. Diplomats and
politicians were supposed to do those things, not soldiers.
Still. Results.
It was all there in the record: initiative, creativity, a willingness to succeed by whatever means
necessary and at whatever cost. Perhaps those inclinations needed to be punished, perhaps only
tempered. The debate might have gone on forever if the story hadn't leaked—but it had, and suddenly
the generals had a hero on their hands.
Sometime during her court-martial, Bates's death sentence turned into a rehabilitation; the only
question was whether it would take place in the stockade or Officer's College. As it turned out,
Leavenworth had both; it took her to its bosom and squeezed hard enough to virtually guarantee
promotion, if it didn't kill her first. Three years later Major Bates was bound for the stars, where she
was heard to say
We're breaking and entering, Siri...
Szpindel was not the first to register doubts. Others had wondered whether her assignment owed as
much to superior qualifications as it did to the resolution of inconvenient PR. I, of course, had no
opinion one way or the other; but I could see how she might strike some as a double-edged sword.
When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, you want to keep an eye on anyone whose career-
defining moment involves consorting with the enemy.
