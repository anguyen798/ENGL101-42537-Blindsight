REALITY IS THAT WHICH, WHEN YOU STOP BELIEVING IN IT, DOESN’T GO AWAY.
—PHILLIP K. DICK
JIM MOORE WAS dancing.
There was no floor to speak of. No partner. Not even any witnesses until Daniel Brüks climbed into the Hub; the command deck was uncharacteristically quiet, no tapping toes or clicking tongues, none of the staccato curses that Sengupta barked out when some command or interface didn’t see things her way. Moore was alone in the cluttered landscape, leaping from a stack of cargo cubes, rebounding off some haphazard plateau halfway down, hitting the deck for just a split-second in a perfect barefoot crouch before bouncing back into the air: one arm tight across his chest, the other jabbing at some invisible partn—
Opponent, Brüks realized. Those open-handed strikes on empty air, that heel coming down with a snap against a passing bulkhead; those were combat moves. Whether he was interacting with a virtual partner in ConSensus or merely faking it old school, Brüks had no idea.
The dancing warrior caught a loose strap of cargo webbing floating from the grille, swung legs overhead and planted them against the bulkhead: hands pulling against strap in lieu of gravity, legs pushing back from the grille in opposition, a human tripod planted against the wall like a three-legged spider. Brüks could clearly see his face. Moore wasn’t even breathing through the mouth.
“Nice moves,” Brüks said.
Moore looked right past him and lifted his feet without a word, turning slowly around the strap like a windmill in a light breeze.
“Uh…”
“Shhh.”
He jumped a little at the hand on his arm. “You don’t want to wake him up,” Lianna said softly. ^Page-156

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-157]]
“He’s asleep?” Brüks looked back at the ceiling; Moore was spinning more quickly now, head out, legs spread in a V, the strap winding tighter between man and metal. In the next instant he was airborne again.
“Sure.” Lianna’s dreads bobbed gently in the wake of her nod. “What, you stay awake when you exercise? You don’t find it, um, boring?”
He didn’t know whether she was taking a shot at the thought of Dan Brüks coming equipped with some kind of sleepwalking option, or the equally ludicrous thought of Dan Brüks working out.
“Why do it at all? A dose of AMPK agonist and he’s a hardbody even if he lies in bed snarfing bonbons all day.”
“Maybe he doesn’t want to depend on augments that can be hacked. Maybe the endorphins give him happier dreams. Maybe old habits die hard.”
Moore sailed over their heads, stabbing the air. Brüks ducked despite himself.
Lianna chuckled. “Don’t worry about that. He can see us just fine.” She caught herself: “Something in there can, anyway.” A kick and a glide took her to the port staircase. “Anyway, don’t waste your time with that loser—the moment he wakes up he’ll just dive back into his Theseus files.” She jerked her chin. “I’ve got some time to kill. Come play with me instead.”
“Play w—” But she’d already turned like a fish and darted down the spoke. He followed her back to the heavy quarters, to the Commons where Moore’s green bottle and his own abandoned gimp hood clung to the bulkhead between bands of minty astroturf.
“Play what?” he asked, catching up. “Tag?”
She grabbed his hood off the wall and tossed it to him, flumping into a convenient hammock in a single smooth motion. “Anything you want. Deity Smackdown. Body-swap boxing is kinda fun. Oh, and there’s a Kardashev sim I’m pretty good at, but I promise to go easy on you.” ^Page-157

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-158]]
He turned the Interloper Accessory over in his hands. The frontal superconductors stared up at him like a pair of startled eyes.
“You do remember that’s mainly a gaming hood, right?”
He shook his head. “I don’t game.”
Lianna eyed him as though he’d just claimed to be a hydrangea. “Why ever not?”
Of course he couldn’t tell her. “It’s not real.”
“It’s not supposed to be,” she explained, surprisingly patient. “That’s what makes them games.”
“Doesn’t feel real.”
“Yeah it does.”
“Not to me.”
“Yeah it does.”
“Not to—”
“Not to put too fine a point on it, Oldschool, but Yes it does.”
“Don’t lecture me about my own perceptions, Lee.”
“It’s the same neurons! The same signal running up the same wiring, and there’s absolutely no way your brain can tell the difference between an electron that came all the way from your retina and one that got injected midstream. Absolutely no way.”
“Doesn’t feel real,” he insisted. “Not to me. And I’m not playing Porn Star Cat Wars with you.”
“Just try, man.”
“Play the AI. It’ll give you a better run for your money anyway.”
“It’s not the sa—”
“Hah!”
Lianna’s face fell. “Fuck. Skewered by my own position statement.”
“By a roach, no less. How’s it feel?”
“Like I just punched myself in the nose,” she admitted.
Neither spoke for a moment.
“Just once? For me?”
“I don’t game.” ^Page-158

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-159]]
“Okay, okay. No harm in asking.”
“Now you’ve asked.”
“Okay.” She swung back and forth in the hammock for a few seconds. (There was something a little off about that motion, a hinted half-spiral oscillation. Coriolis was a subtle trickster.)
“If it makes you feel any better,” she said after a while, “I kinda know what you mean.”
“About?”
“About things not seeming real. I actually feel that way all the time. Gaming’s the only time I don’t feel that way.”
“Huh,” Brüks grunted, a little surprised. “I wonder why.”
And after a moment’s thought: “Probably the company you keep.”
Someone had set up a second tent next to his, stuck it like an engorged white blood cell right at the base of the ladder. Brüks had to effect a half hop sideways off the second rung to avoid bumping it. Something rustled and muttered inside.
“Hello?”
Sengupta stuck her head out, stared at the deck. “Roach.”
Brüks coughed. “You know, that doesn’t actually sound as much like a compliment as you might think.”
She didn’t seem to hear him. “You should see this,” she said, and withdrew.
And poked her head out again after a few seconds: “Well come on.”
He hunkered gingerly down into the tent. Sengupta crouched at its center. Patches of flickering intelligence swarmed across the fabric: columns of numbers; crude plastic-skinned portraits rendered by some computer sketch artist struggling with insufficient eye-witness data; rows of—home addresses, from the look of it.
“What’s this?”
“Nothing you care about.” Reflected lightning played across her face. “Just some fucker going to be eating his own guts when ^Page-159

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-160]]
I get hold of him.” She waved one hand and the collage disappeared.
“You do realize they’ve got a whole hab set up as a dorm,” Brüks said.
“That’s too crowded nobody uses this one.”
“I use—” Never mind.
A roommate might not be so bad, he reflected. He’d have never sought one out—good parasites do not draw attention to themselves, no matter how lonely the lifestyle—but if things went south, maybe Valerie would eat Rakshi first. Buy him some time.
“Watch this best party trick ever.”
She threw a video feed onto the wall: rowdy voices, flashing lights, a mag-lev table wobbling at an insane angle thanks to the drunken asshole trying to dance on the damn thing. Campus bar. The student ambience would be a dead giveaway anywhere on the planet but Brüks was pretty sure it was somewhere in Europe. The subtitler was off but he caught snatches of German and Hungarian at least.
A couple of grad students had randomly arranged a dozen empty beer glasses on a table. A crowd of others cheered and chanted and pulled chairs away, clearing a surrounding space. Something was happening stage left, just out of camera range: an antidisturbance, a sudden contagious quelling of noise and commotion that drew eyes and spread around the circle in an instant. The camera turned toward the eye in the storm. Brüks sucked in his breath.
Valerie again.
She stalked into the cleared floor space like a spring-loaded panther, unleashed, autonomous. She wore the cheap throwaway smart-paper weave ubiquitous to lab rats and convicts the world over; it seemed absurd against the jostling background of blazers and holograms and bioluminescent tattoos. Valerie didn’t seem to notice her own violation of the dress code; didn’t notice the way the front lines pushed back against the crowd as she passed, or ^Page-160

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-161]]
the way the murmuring horde fell silent when she got too close. She had eyes only for the glasses on the table.
What kind of suicidal idiot would take a vampire to a bar? How zoned had these people been, to not be fleeing for the exits?
“Where did you get—”
“Shut up and watch!”
Valerie circled the table, once. She hesitated for a moment, her eyes unfocused, something that might almost have been a smile playing across her lips.
In the next instant, she sprang.
She came down on one bare foot, almost three meters from a standing start; snapped the other down with a stomp, spun and stamped again and jumped—arcing backward this time, over the table itself, flipping in midair and landing in a four-point crouch (left foot right foot right knee left hand) before hopping to the left (stomp), hand-springing forward to land chest-to-face with some semisober sessional who still had enough animal sense to turn greeny-white under a face loaded with retconned chloroplasts. Straight up, now: a vertical one-meter leap with a one-legged landing; about-face (stomp), two diagonal steps toward the table (stomp). Both elbows, one knee crashing simultaneously against ancient floorboards that bounced her smoothly back into a standing position. Finis. After a moment, the camera, shaking despite the very best image-stabilization algorithms a student budget could buy, panned back to the table.
The glasses were arranged in a perfectly straight, evenly spaced line.
“Hard to find this one someone snuck her out the back door you take a vampire out without authorization and your career is over so they really kept the evidence locked up I think it was an initiation or something…”
The view hovered over the tableaux for a long, disbelieving moment. Swung back to the monster who had created it. Valerie stared straight through the camera and a thousand kilometers ^Page-161

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-162]]
beyond, smiled that patented bone-chilling smile. She wasn’t even breathing hard.
Everyone else was, though. Reality was finally cutting through the drinks and the drugs and the sheer idiotic bravado of spoiled children raised on promises of immortality. They were in the presence of black magic. They were in the presence of something whose most trivial efforts turned the very laws of motion into feats of telekinesis. And one sodden instant behind all that awe and stunned disbelief, perhaps, the realization of just what all that vast intelligence, all those superconducting motor skills had evolved in the service of.
Hunting.
It didn’t matter what bedtime stories these privileged brats had been told. They were not immortal in such a presence. They were only breakfast. And it was obvious to Brüks—from the way they pulled back and muttered their excuses, the way they edged for doors while keeping their backs to walls, the way even those pretending to be in charge averted their eyes as they scuttled sidelong up to Valerie and told her in weak and shaking voices that it was time to come in now—that they finally knew it.
It was also obvious, in hindsight, that Brüks had been uncharitable to the baselines who’d stolen their rat from its cage for one wild night out. Whoever they were, they hadn’t been suicidal. They hadn’t been idiots. No matter what they might have told themselves before or after, no matter who remembered having the idea.
It hadn’t really been their decision at all.
The gimp hood did amp his learning curve. Brüks had to admit that much.
Data once forced to timeshare the cramped real estate between bands of astroturf stretched luxuriously around him along three axes and three hundred sixty degrees of infinite space. Options he would have had to make eye contact with on a smart-paint display ^Page-162

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-163]]
leapt front and center the moment he so much as thought about them. Information that he’d normally have to read, and repeat, and review—it seemed to just stick in the brain with a glance and a swallow. He was used to cognitive enhancers, of course, but this had to be Bicameral tech; he couldn’t imagine that even surgical augments would deliver a bigger boost.
Three trillion nodes and a ten-thousand-link search radius was a pretty impoverished echo of the actual Quinternet, but you could still dig for a thousand lifetimes and never reach its edge. Instant expertise in a million disciplines. Interactive novels you didn’t even have to play, first-person eidetic memories that planted themselves directly into your head if you had the interface (Brüks didn’t, but this came close), served up all the thrills and wonder and experience of just having played without even needing to set aside the time to inhabit the story in real time. Indelible footprints of all the things the Noosphere deemed worthy of remembrance.
Even after fourteen years, Theseus was all over it.
The shock, the disbelief in the wake of Firefall. Riots in every color of the rainbow: terrified hordes fleeing the coming apocalypse, not knowing which way to run; demonstrations against movers and shakers who’d always known more than they let on; looters with short attention spans, thinking only of all that swag left undefended while panicked populations hid under their beds or lashed back against uniforms whose guns and drones and area-denial weaponry were finally, after uncounted decades of casual and brutal unaccountability, just not up to the challenge. Tens of thousands returning from Heaven, fearful of new threats from the real world. Millions more fleeing into it, for pretty much the same reason.
And then, Theseus: the Mother Of All Megaprojects. A mission, a metaphor, a symbol of a shattered world reunited against the common threat. The brave souls who manned her, that small select force standing for Humanity against the cosmos. Amanda Bates, champion of countless WestHem campaigns: her skills so  ^Page-163

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-164]]
broad, her talents so highly classified that no one had even heard of her before her ascension to the Dream Team. Lisa Takamatsu, Nobel laureate, linguist and den mother to a half dozen separate personalities living in her own head. Jukka Sarasti, the noble vampire, the lion who’d lain down with lambs and was ready to give his life on their behalf. Siri Keeton, synthesist, ambassador to ambassadors, bridge between—
Wait a second—Siri?
He’d heard that name before. He sifted through dusty old memories laid down before the upgrade. Bulletins and biography washed over them in the meantime: Siri Keeton, synthesist, top of a field consisting exclusively of people at the top of their field. Possessed by demons at the age of six, some convulsive virus straight out of the Middle Ages that lit up his brain with electrical storms. It would have killed him outright if radical surgery hadn’t snatched him back from the brink, patched him up, left him scarred and scared and possessed of something altogether new: a fierce never-say-die dedication to beating the odds, the world, to beating his own mutinous brain into submission and getting the job done, all the way out to the very edge of the solar system and beyond.
(Siri’s not exactly baseline himself, actually…)
Almost nothing about his home life. No home vids, no leaked grade-school psych work-ups. An only child, apparently. Mother not mentioned at all, father left unnamed, a shadowy background figure that refused to come into focus except for one passing reference in TimeSpace:
… owes his single-minded pursuit of personal goals as much to his childhood battle with epilepsy as to his upbringing as a soldier’s son …
Brüks turned the words over in his head, searching for coincidence. ^Page-164

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-165]]
“Yah Colonel Carnage had to go out and get his baby almost killed don’tcha know. Before he was even born.”
The low gravity was no friend; Brüks jumped so high he cracked his head on the ceiling.
“Je-sus!” He pulled back the hood. Sengupta appeared between the interface dissolving in his head and the backup resurrecting on the bulkhead behind her. I have got to figure out the privacy settings on this thing, Brüks told himself. Not that they’d keep her from looking over his shoulder if she really wanted to, he supposed.
“Where did you come from?”
“I’ve been here all along five minutes at least.”
“Well say something next time. Announce yourself.” He rubbed the sore spot on his head. “What are you doing here anyway?”
Sengupta smacked her lips and cast sidelong eyes at her tent. “Hunting a dead man.”
I am the only meat sack on this whole damn ship who isn’t some kind of predator. “Hunting what?” One of the zombies?
“Not on board I mean like you—” Snapping her fingers at the ConSensus display—“hunting him.”
Brüks looked back at the wall: a factoid collage, a palimpsest of puff pieces. It didn’t come anywhere close to biography.
“Jim nearly got him killed?”
“Yah I said that.” Snap snap.
“Says here he had some kind of viral epilepsy.”
Sengupta snorted. “They had to cut out half his brain for viral epilepsy right. Like anyone on Carnage’s salary has to settle for leeches and laudanum when his brat gets sick.”
“So what was it then?”
“Viral something,” Sengupta crowed. “Viral zombieism.”
Ventilator sounds filled the sudden silence.
“Bullshit,” Brüks said softly.
“Oh he didn’t do it deliberately the larva was just collateral. ^Page-165

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-166]]
Some evildoer cooked up a basement bug but he got the fine-tuning wrong. Virus likes fetus brains way better than grown-up brains right? All that growth metabolism all that neural pruning everything moves faster so they give it to Mommy and she gives it to Daddy but it really takes off when it gets past that old-time placenta in the third tri. Goes through baby’s brain faster’n flesh-eating. Wake up next morning the little fucker’s already seizing in the womb and it’s lucky for them it’s their canary in the coal mine, they go down to Emerg and shoot up on antizombals, get cleaned out just in time. But too late for little Siri Keeton. He comes into the world and he’s already damaged goods and they deal with it best they can they try all the best drugs and all the best lattices but it’s downhill all the way and after a few years the seizures start up and that’s all they wrote on Siri Keeton’s left hemisphere right? Had to scrape it out like a rotten coconut.”
“Jesus,” Brüks whispered, and glanced around despite himself.
“Oh you don’t have to worry about him he’s way down deep in his precious Theseus signals.” An odd, single-shouldered shrug. “Anyway it all turned out okay though better’n before like I say. Storm troopers have really good medical plans. Replacement hemisphere’s a big improvement. Made him the man for the mission.”
“What a horrible thing to do to a kid.”
“If you can’t grow the code stay out of the incubator. Fucker probably did it himself to God knows how many others, that’s what they do.”
Brüks had seen the footage, of course: civilian hordes reduced to walking brainstems by a few kilobytes of weaponized code drawn to the telltale biochemistry of conscious thought. It wasn’t the precise surgical excision of cognitive inefficiency, not the military’s reversible supersoldiers or Valerie’s programmed bodyguards. It was consciousness and intellect just chewed away from cortex to hypothalamus, Humanity reduced to fight/flight/fuck. It was people turned back into reptiles.
It was also a hell of an effective strategy for anyone on a budget: ^Page-166

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-167]]
cheap, contagious, terrifyingly effective. If you were caught in some panicking crowd you could never be sure whether the person pushing from behind was trying to rape you, or bash in your skull, or just get the fuck out of the zone. If you were above the crowd all your state-of-the-art telemetry would never tell the undead from the merely undone; not even Tran tech could pick out the fractional chill of a zombie brain inside its skull, not from a distance, not through a wall or a roof, not in the middle of a riot. All you could do was seal off the area and try to keep upwind until the flamethrowers showed up.
They had special squads for that in India, Brüks had heard. People with off switches in their heads, fighting fire with fire. They were really good at their jobs.
“Had it coming you ask me,” Sengupta hissed.
“Jesus, Rakshi.” Brüks shook his head. “What do you have against that guy?”
“Nothing I don’t have against any jackboot who fucks people over and then’s all just following orders.” She poked at some unseen irritant with the toe of her boot. “Look I know you two are dating or whatever okay? Fine with me tell him whatever you want just don’t be surprised when he fucks you over. He’ll feed you into the meat grinder the moment he thinks it serves his greater good. Feed himself in, too, for that matter. I swear sometimes I don’t know which is worse.”
Neither spoke for a few moments.
“Why are you telling me this?” Brüks asked at last.
“Why not?”
“You’re not afraid I’ll pass it on?”
Sengupta barked. “Like you would. Besides he can’t blame me if he stomps his muddy footprints all over the ’base for anyone to see. You coulda seen ’em even.”
Why do I put up with her? Brüks asked himself for the tenth time. And then, for the first: Why does she put up with me?
But he thought he knew that answer already. He’d suspected it at least since she’d moved in next door: Sengupta liked him, in a ^Page-167

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-168]]
weird twisted way. Not sexually. Not as a colleague or a peer, not even as a friend. Sengupta liked Daniel Brüks because he was easy to impress. She didn’t think of him as a person at all; she thought of him as a kind of pet.
Shitty social skills. Rakshi Sengupta was too contemptuous of etiquette to be bothered. But the fact that she didn’t abide by social cues didn’t mean she couldn’t read them. She’d read him well enough, at least; there was no way he’d ever tell Jim Moore what Sengupta had learned about his son. Not Dan Brüks.
He was a good boy.
The next time he saw Lianna, he didn’t.
He heard her voice—“Whoa, watch that—” just a second before the hab tilted crazily askance and pain shot up from—in from …
Actually, he didn’t know where the pain was coming from. It just hurt.
“Holy Heyzeus Dan, you didn’t see that?” Lianna popped magically into existence beside the Commons coffee table as he blinked up from the deck.
The table, he realized. I ran into the table …
He shook his head to clear it. Lianna vanished again—
“Hey—”
—and reappeared.
Brüks hauled himself to his feet, pulled the gimp mask off his face as the pain settled in his left shin. “There’s something wrong with this thing. It’s screwing with my eyes.”
She reached out and took it. “Looks okay. What were you doing?”
“Just trawling the cache. Thought I’d bookmarked an article but I can’t find the damn thing.”
“You encrypt the search?”
Brüks shook his head. Lianna far-focused into ConSensus. ^Page-168

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-169]]
“Szpindel et al? ‘Gamma-protocadherin and the role of the PCDH11Y ortholog’”?
“That’s the one.”
“It’s right here.” She frowned, handed back the gimp hood. “Try again.”
He pulled it back on over his head. Search results reappeared in the air before him, but Szpindel wasn’t among them. “Still nothing.”
“Hmm,” Lianna said, and vanished.
“Where are you? You just dis—”
She leaned back into view from nowhere in particular.
“—appeared.”
“There’s the problem,” she said, and peeled the gimp hood back off his scalp. “Induced hemineglect. Probably a bad superconductor.”
“Hemineglect?”
“See why you should get augged? You could just pull up a subtitle, know exactly what I’m talking about.”
“See why I don’t?” Brüks conjured up a definition out of smart paint. “Nobody has to cut my head open to replace a bad superconductor.”
Broken brains that split the body down the middle and threw half of it away: an inability to perceive anything to the left of the body’s midline, to even conceive of anything there. People who only combed their hair on the right side with their right hands, who only saw food on the right side of their plates. People who just forgot about half the universe.
“That is fucked,” Brüks said, quietly awed.
Lianna shrugged. “Like I said, a bad superconductor. We got spares, though; faster’n fabbing a replacement.”
He followed her through the ceiling. “So you never told me why you were so old school,” she said over her shoulder.
“Fear of vivisection. When superconductors go bad. We covered this.” ^Page-169

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-170]]
“The reason that stuff goes bad is because it’s crappy old tech. Internal augs are less failure-prone than your own brain.”
“So they’ll work flawlessly when some spambot hacks in and leaves me with an irresistible urge to buy a year’s supply of bubble bath for cats.”
“Hey, at least the augs are firewalled. It’s way easier to hack a raw brain, if that’s what you’re worried about.
“Then again,” she added, “I don’t think it is.”
He sighed. “No. I guess it isn’t.”
“What, then?”
They emerged into the southern hemisphere. Their reflections, thin as eels, slid across the mirrorball as they passed.
“Know what a funnel-web spider is?” Brüks asked at last.
After the barest hesitation: “I do now.” And a moment later, “Oh. The neurotoxins.”
“Not just any neurotoxins. This one was special. Pharm refugee maybe, or just some open-source hobby that got loose. Might have even been beneficial under other circumstances, for all I know. The little fucker got away. But I felt a nip, right about here”—he spread the fingers of one hand, tapped the webbing between thumb and forefinger with the other—“and I was flat on my back ten seconds later.” He snorted softly. “Taught me not to go sampling without gloves, anyway.”
They crossed the equator, single file. No one in the northern hemisphere.
“Didn’t kill you though,” Lianna observed shrewdly.
“Nah. Just induced the mother of all allergic responses to nanopore antiglials. Any kind of direct neural interface finishes what that little bugger started.”
“They could fix that, you know.” Lianna bounced off the deck and glided along the forward ladder, Brüks clambering in her wake.
“Sure they could. I could take some proprietary drug for the rest of my life and let FizerPharm squeeze my balls every time they change their terms and conditions. Or I could get my whole ^Page-170

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-171]]
immune system ripped out and replaced. Or I can take a couple of pills every day.”
The attic.
A warren of pipes and conduits, an engineering subbasement at the top of the ship. Plumbing, docking hatches, great wraparound bands full of tools and spacesuits and EVA accessories. Stone Age control panels in the catastrophic event that anyone might need to take manual control. A stale breeze caressed Brüks’s face from some overhead ventilator; he tasted oil and electricity. Up ahead the docking airlock bulged to starboard like a tinfoil hubcap three meters across; a smaller lock, merely man-size, played sidekick across the compartment. Spacesuits drifted in their alcoves like dormant silver larvae. Portals and panels crowded the spaces between struts and LOX tanks and CO2 scrubbers: lockers, bus boards, a head gimbaled for variable gee.
Lianna cracked one of the lockers and began rummaging about inside.
Yet another ladder climbed farther forward, out of the attic and up along a spire of dimly lit scaffolding. Afferent sensor array up there, according to the map. Maneuvering thrusters. And the parasol: that great wide conic of programmable metamaterial the Crown would hide behind when the sun got too close. Photosynthetic, according to the specs. Brüks didn’t know whether it would shuttle enough electrons to run whatever backup drive the Bicamerals were putting together, but at least hot showers were always an option.
“Got it.” Lianna held up a greasy-looking gray washer, smiling.
For a moment. The look of triumph drained from her face while Brüks watched; the expression left behind was bloodless and terrified.
“Lee…?”
She sucked in breath, and didn’t let it out. She stared past his right shoulder as if he were invisible.
He spun, expecting monsters. Nothing to see but the airlock. ^Page-171

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-172]]
Nothing to hear but the clicks and sighs of the Crown of Thorns, talking to itself.
“Do you hear that?” she whispered. Her eyes moved in terrified little saccades. “That—ticking…”
He heard the sigh of recycled air breathed into cramped spaces, the soft rustle of empty spacesuits stirring in the breeze. He heard faint muffled sounds of movement from below: a scrape, a hard brief footfall. Brüks looked around the compartment, swept his eyes past alcoves and airlocks—
Now he heard something: sharp, soft, arrhythmic. Not a ticking so much as a clicking, a sound like, like a clicking tongue perhaps. A hungry sound, from overhead.
His stomach dropped away.
He didn’t have to look. He didn’t dare to. Somehow he could feel her up there in the rafters: a dark predatory shadow, watching from places where the light couldn’t quite reach.
The sound of teeth tapping together.
“Shit,” Lianna whispered.
She can’t be up there, Brüks thought. He’d checked the board before leaving the Commons. He always checked. Valerie’s icon had been down in her hab where it always was, a green dot among gray ones. She must have really moved.
Of course, they could do that.
Now those clicking teeth were so loud he didn’t know how he could have missed them. There was no pattern to that sound, no regular predictable rhythm. The silences between clicks stretched forever, drove him insane with trivial suspense; or snapped unexpectedly closed after a split second.
“Let’s—” Brüks swallowed, tried again. “Let’s get…”
But Lianna was already headed aft.
The Hub was bright light and sterile reflections: the soft glow of the walls chased Brüks’s fears back to the basement where they belonged. He looked at Lianna a bit sheepishly as they rounded the mirrorball.
Lianna did not look sheepish at all. If anything, she looked ^Page-172

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-173]]
more worried than she had in the attic. “She must have hacked the sensors.”
“What do you mean?”
She wiggled her fingers in midair; INTERCOM appeared on the bulkhead. Sengupta was astern near the Hold; Moore was back in the Dorm.
Valerie’s icon glowed reassuring green, down in her own private hab with the grays.
“Ship doesn’t know where she is anymore,” Lianna said. “She could be anywhere. Other side of any door you open.”
“Why would she do that?” Brüks glanced up at the hole in the ceiling as Lianna grabbed the ladder. “What was she even doing up there?”
“Did you see her?”
He shook his head. “Couldn’t look.”
“Me neither.”
“So for all we know, she wasn’t even up there.”
She managed a nervous laugh. “You wanna go back and check?”
Here among the bright lights and the gleaming machinery, it was hard not to feel utterly ridiculous. Brüks shook his head. “Even if she is up there, so what? It’s not like she’s confined to quarters. It’s not like she did anything other than—grind her teeth.”
“She’s a predator,” Lianna pointed out.
“She’s a sadist. She’s been pushing my buttons since day one; I think she just gets off on it. Jim’s right: if she wanted to kill us we’d be dead already.”
“Maybe this is how she kills us,” Lianna said. “Maybe she mambos.”
“Mambos.”
“Vodou works, Oldschool. Fear messes up your cardiac rhythms. Adrenaline kills heart cells. You can literally scare someone to death if you hack the sympathetic nervous system the right way.”
So voodoo’s real, Brüks mused.
Chalk one up for organized religion. ^Page-173

Moore was heading down when Brüks was heading out.
“Hey Jim.”
“Daniel.”
It didn’t happen often anymore. Whether at meals or after, during the Crown’s bright blue day or the warmer shadows of its night cycle, the Colonel always seemed to be deep in ConSensus these days. He never talked about what he did there. Cramming for Icarus, of course. Reviewing the telemetry Theseus had sent before disappearing into the fog. But he kept those details to himself, even when he came out to breathe.
Brüks stopped at the foot of the Commons ladder. “Hey, you want to see a movie?”
“A what?”
“The Silences of Pone. Like a game you can only watch. Lee says it’s one of—you know, back when they couldn’t just induce desired states directly. They had to manipulate you into feeling things. With plot and characters and so on.”
“Art,” Moore said. “I remember.”
“Pretty crude by current standards but apparently it won a whole bunch of awards for neuroinduction back in the day. Lee found it in the cache, set up a feed. Says it’s worth watching.”
“That woman is getting to you,” the Colonel remarked.
“This whole fucking voyage is getting to me. You in?”
He shook his head. “Still reviewing the telemetry.”
“You’ve been doing that for a week now. You hardly come up for air.”
“There’s a lot of telemetry.”
“I thought they went in and went dark.”
“They did.”
“Almost immediately, you said.”
“Almost is a relative term. Theseus had more eyes than a small corporation. Take a lifetime to sift through even a few minutes of that feed.” ^Page-174

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-175]]
“For a baseline, maybe. Surely the Bicams have everything in hand.”
Moore looked at him. “I thought you didn’t approve of blind faith in higher powers.”
“I don’t approve of breaking your back pushing boulders uphill when you’re eyeprinted for the heavy lifter across the street, either. You said it yourself. They’re a hundred steps ahead of us. We’re just here to enjoy the ride.”
“Not necessarily.”
“How so?”
“We’re here. They’re stuck in decompression for the next six days.”
“Right,” Brüks remembered. “Field-tested.”
“Why they brought us along.”
Brüks grimaced. “They brought me along because I happened to stumble onto the highway and they didn’t have the heart to see me turn into roadkill.”
The Colonel shrugged. “Doesn’t mean they can’t make the most of an opportunity when it presents itself.”
Brüks’ fingertips tingled in remembrance. Opportunities, he realized with sudden dull surprise.
I’m missing one.
It was a window in the crudest possible sense: a solid pane of transparent alloy, set into the rear bulkhead. You couldn’t zoom it or resize it or lay a tactical false-color overlay across its surface. You couldn’t even turn it off, unless someone on the other side brought down the blast shield. It was a clear, impenetrable hole in the ship: a circular viewport into an alien terrarium where, out past the ghostly reflection of his own face, strange hyperbaric creatures built monstrous artifacts out of sand and coral. Their eyes twinkled like green stars in the gloom.
Six of the monks were resting, suspended in medical cocoons ^Page-175

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-176]]
like dormant grubs waiting out the winter. The others moved purposeful as ants across a background of shadows and half-built machinery: a jumbled cityscape of tanks and stacked ceramic superconductors and segments of pipe big enough to walk through without ducking. Brüks was pretty sure that the patchwork sphere coming together near the center of the hold was shaping up to be the fusion chamber.
Two of the Bicamerals huddled off to one side in some sort of wordless back-to-back communion. A glistening gelatinous orb floated beside them. Someone else (Evans, that was it) seized a nearby hand tool and lobbed it to starboard. It spun lazily end over end until Chodorowska reached up and snatched it from the air, without ever taking her eyes off the component in her other hand.
She’d never even looked. Which was not to say she hadn’t seen it coming.
But of course there was no her. Not right now, anyway. There was no Evans or Ofoegbu either.
There was only the hive.
How had Moore put it? Cognitive subspecies. But the Colonel didn’t get it. Neither did Lianna; she’d shared her enthusiastic blindness with Brüks over breakfast that very morning, ticked off in hushed and reverent tones the snips and splices that had so improved her masters: No TPN suppression, no Semmelweis reflex. They’re immune to inattentional blindness and hyperbolic discounting, and Oldschool, that synesthesia of theirs—they reset millions of years of sensory biases with that trick. Randomized all the errors, just like that. And it’s not just the mundane sensory stuff, it’s not just feeling color and tasting sounds. They can literally see time …
As if those were good things.
In a way, of course, they were. All those gut feelings, right or wrong, that had kept the breed alive on the Pleistocene savannah—and they were wrong, so much of the time. False negatives, false positives, the moral algebra of fat men pushed in front of onrushing trolleys. The strident emotional belief that children made you ^Page-176

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-177]]
happy, even when all the data pointed to misery. The high-amplitude fear of sharks and dark-skinned snipers who would never kill you; indifference to all the toxins and pesticides that could. The mind was so rotten with misrepresentation that in some cases it literally had to be damaged before it could make a truly rational decision—and should some brain-lesioned mother abandon her baby in a burning house in order to save two strangers from the same fire, the rest of the world would be more likely to call her a monster than laud the rationality of her lifeboat ethics. Hell, rationality itself—the exalted Human ability to reason—hadn’t evolved in the pursuit of truth but simply to win arguments, to gain control: to bend others, by means logical or sophistic, to your will.
Truth had never been a priority. If believing a lie kept the genes proliferating, the system would believe that lie with all its heart.
Fossil feelings. Better off without them, once you’d outgrown the savannah and decided that Truth mattered after all. But Humanity wasn’t defined by arms and legs and upright posture. Humanity had evolved at the synapse as well as at the opposable thumb—and those misleading gut feelings were the very groundwork on which the whole damn clade had been built. Capuchins felt empathy. Chimps had an innate sense of fair play. You could look into the eyes of any cat or dog and see a connection there, a legacy of common subroutines and shared emotions.
The Bicamerals had cut away all that kinship in the name of something their stunted progenitors called Truth, and replaced it with—something else. They might look human. Their cellular metabolism might lie dead on the Kleiber curve. But to merely call them a cognitive subspecies was denial to the point of delusion. The wiring in those skulls wasn’t even mammalian anymore. A look into those sparkling eyes would show you nothing but—
“Hey.”
Lianna’s reflection bobbed upside down next to his in the window. He turned as she reached past and unhooked her pressure suit from its alcove. “Hey.” ^Page-177

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-178]]
His eyes wandered back to the window. The back-to-back Bicamerals had ended their joint trance; they turned, simultaneously plunged their hands into the wobbling sphere at their side (Water, Brüks realized: it’s just a blob of water), dried off on a towel leashed to the bulkhead.
“I didn’t know,” he said, too quietly. As if afraid they’d hear him through the bulkhead. “How they work. What they—are.”
“Really.” She checked her suit O2. “I would’ve thought the eyes’d be a giveaway.”
“I just assumed that was for night vision. Hell, I know people who retro fluorescent proteins as a fashion statement.”
“Yeah, now. Back in the day they were—”
“Diagnostic markers. I figured it out.” After Moore had inspired him to go back and actually look at the thing that had left all those corpses twisted like so much driftwood in the Oregon desert. It still lingered in his own blood, after all—and it had been almost too easy, the way the lab had taken that chimera apart and spread-eagled every piece for his edification. Streptococcal subroutines lifted from necrotizing myelitis; viral encephalitides laterally promoted from their usual supporting role in limbic encephalitis; a polysaccharide in the cell wall with a special affinity for the nasal mucosa. A handful of synthetic subroutines, built entirely from scratch, to glue all those incompatible pieces together and keep them from fighting.
But it had been the heart of that piecemeal bug that had betrayed the hive to Brüks’s investigations: a subroutine targeting a specific mutation of the p53 gene. He hadn’t got any direct hits when he’d run a search on that mutation, but the nearest miss was close enough to spill the secret: a tumor antagonist patented almost thirty years before.
As if someone had weaponized an anticancer agent.
“Doesn’t it bother you?” he wondered now.
The suit had swallowed her to the waist. “Why should it?”
“They’re tumors, Lee. Literally. Thinking tumors.”
“That’s a pretty gross oversimplification.” ^Page-178

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-179]]
“Maybe.” He wasn’t clear on the details. Hypomethylation, CpG islands, methylcytosine—black magic, all of it. The precise and deliberate rape of certain methylating groups to turn interneurons cancerous, just so: a synaptic superbloom that multiplied every circuit a thousandfold. It was no joyful baptism, as far as Brüks could tell. There’d be no ecstasy in that rebirth. It was a breakneck overgrowth of weedy electricity that nearly killed its initiates outright, pulled sixty-million-year-old circuits out by the roots.
Lianna was right: the path was subtle and complex beyond human imagining, controlled with molecular precision, tamed by whatever drugs and dark arts the Bicamerals used to keep all that overgrowth from running rampant. But when the rites and incantations had been spoken, when the deed had been done and the patient sewn up, it all came down to one thing:
They’d turned their brains into cancer.
“I was so worked up about Luckett.” Brüks shook his head at his own stupidity. “We just left him back there to die, you know, we left all of them—but he would have died anyway, wouldn’t he? As soon as he graduated. Every pathway that ever made him what he was, the cancer would eat it all and replace it with something…”
“Something better,” Lianna said.
“That’s a matter of opinion.”
“You make it sound so horrible.” Wrist seals. Click click. “But you know, you went through pretty much the same thing yourself and you don’t seem any the worse for it.”
He imagined coming apart. He imagined every thread of conscious experience fraying and dissolving and being eaten away. He imagined dying, while the body lived on.
“I don’t think so,” he said.
“Sure. When you were a baby.” She laid a gloved hand on his shoulder. “We all start out with heads full of random mush; it’s the neural pruning afterward that shapes who we are. It’s like, like sculpture. You start with a block of granite, chip away the ^Page-179

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-11#^Page-180]]
bits that don’t belong, end up with a work of art. The Bicams just start over with a bigger block.”
“But it’s not you.”
“Enough of it is.” She plucked her helmet out of the air.
“Sure, the memories stick.” Some elements were spared: in the thalamus and cerebellum, hippocampus and brain stem all left carefully unscathed by a holocaust with the most discriminating taste. “But something else is remembering them.”
“Dan, you gotta let go of this whole self thing. Identity changes by the second, you turn into someone else every time a new thought rewires your brain. You’re already a different person than you were ten minutes ago.” She lowered the helmet over her head, yanked it counterclockwise until it clicked into place. His fish-eye reflection slid bulging across her faceplate as she turned.
“What about you, Lianna?” he asked softly.
“What about me?” Her voice muffled and breathy across the glass.
“You aspiring to the same fate?”
She eyed him sadly from the bowl of her helmet. “It’s not like you think. Really.” And passed on to some farther shore. ^Page-180
