EITHER WAR IS OBSOLETE, OR MEN ARE.
—R. BUCKMINSTER FULLER
TWO GUARDS STOOD at the door halfway down the hall, one to each side, like a couple of dark golems in matching pajamas. Brüks had not been invited to the party inside but he followed Moore at a distance, hanging back along the edge of the corridor for want of any other destination. Bicamerals brushed past in both directions, going about whatever business involved the domestication of weaponized whirlwinds. They seemed unremarkable in the morning light slanting through the windows. No arcane ululations. No vestments or hooded robes, no uniforms of any kind that Brüks could make out. A couple wore denim. One, preoccupied with a tacpad as he passed, was stark naked except for the tattoo squirming along his chest: some kind of winged animal Brüks was pretty sure didn’t exist anywhere in the taxonomic database.
They still had stars in their eyes, though.
Ahead, Moore stepped between the guards and into the room. Brüks sidled up in his wake. The sentries stood still as stone, barefoot, faces forward, their beige coveralls identically featureless. Empty holsters hung from their belts.
Their lightless eyes wouldn’t stop moving. They jiggled and jerked in panicked little arcs, back and forth, up and down, as though terrified souls had been buried alive in wet cement. Someone coughed softly down the hall. All four eyes locked on that sound for the merest instant, froze in synchronized quadrascopic far focus: then broke, and resumed struggling in their sockets.
There was a market niche for zombies, Brüks had read, among those who still took their sex in the first person. He tried to imagine fucking any creature possessed of such eyes, and shuddered.
He passed by on the far side of the hall. Parallax served up a moving slice of the room behind the door: Jim Moore, a tabletop holo display in standby mode, a handful of Bicamerals nodding ^Page-50

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-51]]
among themselves. A woman: lean as a greyhound beneath a mimetic body stocking, a bone-pale face under a spiky shock of short black hair, jawline just a bit more prognathous than any card-carrying prey might feel comfortable with. She turned her head as Brüks crept by. Her eyes flashed like a cat’s. She bared her teeth. On anyone else it would have been a smile.
The door swung shut.
“Hey. Hungry?”
He jumped at the hand on his arm but it was only a woman, dreadlocked and gracile and with a smile that warmed his skin instead of freezing it. Her skin was uniform chocolate, not the rainbow swirl of false-color it had been the night before; but he recognized the voice.
“Lianna.” He grunted, taking her in. “You’re the first person I’ve seen here who’s actually dressed like a monk.”
“It’s a bathrobe. We’re not really into gang colors around here.” She jerked her chin down the hall. “C’mon. Breakfast.”
They selected their meals from a commons that looked reassuringly like a conventional cafeteria bar (cloned bacon, Brüks was relieved to see; he’d been afraid the Bicamerals would be vegan traditionalists), but they ate sitting on the sprawling steps of the main entrance, watching the morning shadows shorten by degrees across the desert. The quiet hiss of an idling tornado drifted over the ramparts behind them.
“That was quite the night,” Brüks said around a mouthful of egg.
“Quite the morning, too.”
He raised his eyes. Far overhead, the contrail of some passing airbus etched a line across the sky.
“Oh, it’s still up there,” Lianna remarked. “Kinda flickers in and out of the higher wavelengths if you stare hard enough.”
“I can’t see it.”
“What kind of augments you got?” ^Page-51

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-52]]
“For my eyes? Nothing.” Brüks dropped his gaze back to the horizon. “Got wired with cryptochrome back when it was the Next Big Thing, thought it would help me find my way around down in Costa Rica. You know the ads, never be lost again. Except suddenly I wasn’t just seeing Earth’s magnetic field, I was seeing a halo around every bloody tacpad and charge mat. It was distracting as hell.”
Lianna nodded. “Well, it takes some getting used to. Give sight to the blind, takes time to learn how to see.”
“More than I had the patience for. Pigment’s still sitting back there in my retina but I got it blocked after about a week.”
“Wow. You’re old school.”
He fought back a twitch of irritation: Half my age, and she’s probably already forgotten the difference between the meat she was born with and the chrome that came after. “I’ve got the usual brain boosts. Can’t very well get tenure otherwise.” Which reminds me—“I don’t suppose there’s any Cognital on the premises? I left mine back at camp.”
Lianna’s eyes widened. “You take pills?”
“It’s the same—”
“It’d take about ten minutes to fit you with a pump and you take pills.” Her face split into a big goofy grin. “That’s not old school, that’s downright Paleolithic.”
“Glad you find it so fucking amusing, Lianna. You have the pills or not?”
“Not.” She pursed her lips. “I guess we could synthesize some. I’ll ask. Or you might ask Jim. He’s, well…”
“Old school,” Brüks finished.
“Actually, you’d be surprised how much wiring he’s got in his head.”
“I’m surprised to even find him here. Military man in a monastery?”
“Yeah, well, you were expecting us all to wear bathrobes.”
“He’s here to help you in your war against the vamps?” Brüks set his empty plate beside him on the step. ^Page-52

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-53]]
She shook her head. “He’s here to—he just needed a place to work through some stuff. Also I think he’s kinda spying on us.” She cocked her head at him: “What about you?”
“I got herded,” he reminded her.
“No, I mean, what were you even doing out in the field? There any species even left out there that haven’t been RAMrodded and digitized?”
“The extinct ones,” Brüks said shortly. Then, relenting: “Sure, you can virtualize anything in the lab. Still doesn’t tell you what it’s doing out in the wide wet world with a million unpredictable variables working on it.”
She looked out across the flats. Brüks followed her gaze. There, just off to the northwest: the ridge upon which his own home had crouched lo these past two months. He could not see it from here.
“You gonna tell me what’s going on?” he said at last.
“You got caught in the crossfire.”
“What crossfire? Why were the zombies—”
“The vampire,” Lianna said. “Valerie, actually.”
“You’re kidding.”
She shrugged.
“So Valerie the Vampire summons her zombie forces against the Bicamerals. And now they’re all sitting together just down the hall, munching chips and cocktail wienies because—Moore said something about a common enemy.”
“It’s complicated.”
“Try me.”
“You wouldn’t understand.” She tried for a smile—“You’re behind on your Cognital”—but it fell flat.
“Look, I’m sorry I crashed your party but—”
“Dan, the truth is I don’t really know a whole lot more than you do at this point.” She spread her hands. “All I can tell you for sure is, well, you gotta trust them. They know what they’re doing.”
She stopped just short of patting him on the head.
He stood. “Glad to hear it. Then I guess I’ll leave you to your games, and thanks for the meal.” ^Page-53

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-54]]
She looked up at him. “You know that can’t happen. Jim already told you that much.”
“Are you going to tell me where my bike is, or do I have to walk?”
“You can’t leave, Dan.”
“You can’t keep me prisoner.”
“It’s not us you have to worry about.”
“Who’s us, this time? Bicamerals, vampires? Koalas?”
She pointed north across the desert, squinting. “Look out there. On that ridge.”
He did. He saw nothing at first. Then, briefly, something glinted in the morning sun: a spark on the escarpment.
“Now look up,” she said. A distant shard of brightness stabbed his eye from high to the east, a reflection of sunlight off empty sky.
“Not us,” Lianna repeated. “You.”
“Me—?”
“People like you. Baselines.”
He let it sink in.
“Valerie must have hacked a fair number of sats just getting her pieces into position. As far as anything in orbit could tell, this whole chunk of desert just dropped out of existence for a good four hours last night. That got people’s attention. Someone probably slipped a drone or two under the ceiling in time to see our engine going through its paces—and those dance steps are, shall we say, a bit beyond what passes for state-of-the-art out there.” Lianna sighed. “The Bicamerals have been spooking the wrong people for years now. Too many breakthroughs, too fast, the usual. They’ve been watching, all this time they’ve been watching. And now, as far as they can tell, we’re in some kind of gang war with a bunch of zombies.
“They are not going to let this pass, Dan. Now that they’ve caught a glimpse behind the curtain they’ll have thrown a net over the whole reserve.”
And I, Brüks reflected, don’t blame them one goddamned bit. “I’m not part of this. You said it yourself.” ^Page-54

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-55]]
“You’re a witness. They’ll debrief you.”
“So they’ll debrief me.” Brüks shrugged. “You haven’t told me anything. I haven’t seen anything they haven’t, if they deployed drones.”
“You’ve seen more than you realize. Everyone does. And they will know that, so your debriefing with be aggressive.”
“So that makes you, what? My personal guard? Here to feed me, and walk me, and make sure I don’t wander off into any of the rooms where the grown-ups are talking. And yank on my leash if I try to leave. That about sum it up?”
“Dan—”
“Look, you’re giving me a choice between a vampire with her zombie army and you baselines, as you so delicately put it.”
She got to her feet. “I’m not giving you a choice.”
“I have to leave sometime. I can’t spend the rest of my life here.”
“If you try to leave now,” she said, “that’s exactly what you’ll have done.”
He looked down at her: thin as a pussy willow, she only came up to his chest.
“You going to stop me?”
She looked back without blinking. “I’m gonna try. If I have to. But I really hope it doesn’t come to that.”
He stood there for the longest time. Then he picked up his plate.
“Fuck you,” he said, and went back inside.
Within his prison, she gave him all the space in the world. She backed right off as he stalked down the hall, past the murmuring of the devout and the hyperkinetic gaze of the frozen zombies, past the closed-door deliberations of enemies-of-enemies and the open doors of dorms and studies and bathrooms. He moved without direction at first, following any corridor that presented itself, backtracking from every cul-de-sac, his feet exploring autonomously ^Page-55

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-56]]
while his gut churned. After a while, some dull sullen pain behind his eyes brought him back to the here-and-now; he took more conscious note of his surroundings and decided to revisit Moore’s basement watchtower, as much for its relative familiarity as for any tactical insights he might glean.
He couldn’t find it. He remembered Lianna leading him through a hole in the wall; he remembered emerging from it after the armistice. It had to be off the main corridor, had to lie behind one of these identical oaken doors that lined the hall, but no perspective along that length seemed familiar. It was as though he was in some off-kilter mock-up of the place he’d been just an hour before, as though the layout of the monastery had changed subtly when he wasn’t looking. He started trying doors at random.
The third was ajar. Low voices murmured behind it. It swung inward easily; flat panels of vat-cloned hardwood lined the space beyond, a kind of library or map room that looked out onto a grassy compound (half sunlit, half in shadow) past the opposite end of the room. Past sliding glass doorways, arcane objects rose haphazardly from that immaculate lawn. Brüks couldn’t tell whether they were machines or sculptures or some half-assed hybrid of the two. The only thing that looked at all familiar out there was a shallow washbasin set atop a boxy waist-high pedestal.
There was another one of those inside, too, just past a conference table that dominated the center of the room itself. Two mismatched Bicamerals stood at the table’s edge, gazing at a collection of dice-size objects scattered across some kind of hard-copy map or antique game board. The Japanese monk was gaunt as a scarecrow; the Caucasian could have passed for Santa Claus at the departmental Christmas party, given the right threads and a pillow stuffed down his front.
“From Queensland, maybe,” Santa remarked. “That place always bred the best neurotoxins.”
The scarecrow scooped up a handful of objects (not dice, Brüks saw now; a collection of multifaceted lumps that made him think ^Page-56

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-57]]
of mahogany macramé) and arranged them in a rough crescent across the board.
Santa considered. “Still not enough. Even if we could sift the Van Allens dry on short notice.” He absently scratched the side of his neck, seemed to notice Brüks at last. “You’re the refugee.”
“Biologist.”
“Welcome anyway.” Santa smacked his lips. “I’m Luckett.”
“Dan Brüks.” He took the other man’s nod for an invitation and stepped closer to the table. The pattern decorating the game board—a multicolored spiral of interlocking Penrose tiles—was far more complex than any he remembered from his grandfather’s attic. It seemed to move at the corner of his eye, to crawl just so when he wasn’t quite looking.
The scarecrow clicked his tongue, eyes never leaving the table.
“Don’t mind Masaso,” Luckett remarked. “He’s not much for what you’d call normal conversation.”
“Does everyone around here speak in tongues?”
“Speak—oh, I see what you mean.” Luckett laughed softly. “No, with Masaso here it’s more like a kind of aphasia. When he’s not linked in, anyway.”
The scarecrow spilled a few more mahogany knuckles with chaotic precision. Luckett laughed again, shook his head.
“He talks through board games,” Brüks surmised.
“Close enough. Who knows? I might be doing the same thing by the time I graduate.”
“You’re not—?” Of course he wasn’t. His eyes didn’t sparkle.
“Not yet. Acolyte.”
It was enough that he spoke English. “I’m trying to find the room I was in last night. Basement, spiral stairs, kind of a war room bunker feel to it?”
“Ah. The Colonel’s lair. North hall, first right, second door on the left.”
“Okay. Thanks.”
“Not at all.” Luckett turned away as Masaso clicked and rolled ^Page-57

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-58]]
the bones. “More than enough antimatter to break orbit, anyway. Least it saves on chemical mass.”
Brüks stopped, hand on the doorknob. “What was that?”
Luckett glanced back at him. “Just drawing up plans. Nothing to worry about.”
“You guys have antimatter?”
“Before long.” Luckett grinned and dipped his hands into the washbasin. “God willing.”
Most of the tactical collage was dark, or writhing with analog static. A half dozen windows flickered fitfully through random points of view: desert, desert, desert. No satcam imagery. Either Moore had shut down those feeds or whoever was behind the blockade had walled off the sky as well as the horizon.
Brüks tapped experimentally on an unlit patch of paint. His touch provoked a brief flicker of red, but nothing else.
The active windows kept changing, though. Some kind of motion sensor built into the feed, maybe: views would pan and pounce, flash-zooming on this flickering shadow or that distant escarpment. Sometimes Brüks couldn’t see anything noteworthy at the center of attention: a falcon grooming itself on a skeletal branch, or the burrow of a desert rodent halfway to the horizon. Once or twice a little fall of rock skittering down a distant slope, scree dislodged by some unseen disturbance.
Once, partially eclipsed by leaves and scrub, a pair of glassy reflections looking back.
“Help you?”
Jim Moore reached past Brüks’s shoulder and tapped the display. A new window sprang to life at his fingertip. Brüks stepped aside while the soldier stretched the window across the paint, called up a feed, zoomed on a crevice splitting a hillock to the south.
“I was trying to get online,” Brüks admitted. “See if anyone out there’s picked up on this whole—quarantine thing.” ^Page-58

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-59]]
“Net’s strictly local. I don’t think the Bicamerals actually have Quinternet access.”
“What, they’re afraid of getting hacked?” It was an ongoing trend, Brüks had heard: defensive self-partitioning in the face of Present Shock, and damn the legal consequences. People were starting to weigh costs against benefits, opt for a day or two outside the panopticon even in the face of the inevitable fines and detentions.
But Moore was shaking his head. “I don’t think they need it. Do you feel especially lost without access to the telegraph network?”
“What’s a telegraph?”
“Exactly.” Something caught the Colonel’s eye. “Huh. That’s not good.”
Brüks followed the other man’s gaze to the window he’d opened, to the crevice centered there. “I don’t see anything.”
Moore played a little arpeggio on the wall. The image blossomed into false color. Something glowed Euclidean yellow in all that fractal blue.
He grunted. “Aerosol delivery, looks like.”
“Your guys?”
The corner of Moore’s mouth curled the slightest bit. “Can’t really say.”
“What’s to say? You’re a soldier, right? They’re soldiers, unless the government’s started subcontracting to—”
“Biothermals, too. They’re not trusting their bots to run things.” There was a hint of amusement in the old soldier’s voice. “Probably baselines, then.”
“Why’s that?”
“Fragile egos. Low self-esteem.” His fingers skipped across the darkened wall. Bright windows flared everywhere they touched.
“At least you’re all on the same side then, right?”
“Doesn’t really work like that.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“The chain of command isn’t what it used to be.” Moore smiled ^Page-59

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-60]]
faintly. “It’s more—organic, these days. Anyway.” Another finger dance; the window dwindled and slid to an empty spot along the edge of the wall. “They’re still setting up. We’ve got time.”
“How was the meeting?” Brüks asked
“Still going on. Not much point hanging around after the opening ceremonies, though. I’d just slow them down.”
“And let me guess: you can’t tell me what’s going on, and it’s none of my business anyway.”
“Why would you say that?”
“Lianna said—”
“Dr. Lutterodt wasn’t at the meeting,” Moore reminded him.
“Okay. So is there anything you can—”
“The Fireflies,” Moore said.
Brüks blinked. “What about—oh. Your common enemy.”
Moore nodded.
Memories of intercepted negotiations, scrolling past in Christmas colors: “Theseus. They found something out there?”
“Maybe. Nothing’s certain yet, just—hints and inferences. No solid intel.”
“Still.” An alien agency capable of simultaneously dropping sixty thousand surveillance probes into the atmosphere without warning. An agency that came and went in seconds, that caught the planet with its pants down and took God knew how many compromising pictures along God knew how many wavelengths before letting the atmosphere burn its own paparazzi down to a sprinkle of untraceable iron floating through the stratosphere. An agency never seen before and never since, for all the effort put into finding it. “I guess that qualifies as a common threat,” Brüks admitted.
“I guess it does.” Moore turned back to his war wall.
“Why were they fighting in the first place? What does a vampire have against a bunch of monks?”
Moore didn’t answer for a moment. Then: “It’s not personal, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
“What, then?” ^Page-60

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-61]]
Moore took a breath. “It’s—more of the same, really. Entropy, increasing. The Realists and their war on Heaven. The Nanohistomites over in Hokkaido. Islamabad on fire.”
Brüks blinked. “Islamabad’s—”
“Oops. Getting ahead of myself. Give it time.” The Colonel shrugged. “I’m not trying to be coy, Dr. Brüks. You’re already in the soup, so I’ll tell you what I can so long as it doesn’t endanger you further. But you’re going to have to take a lot on—well, on faith.”
Brüks stifled a laugh. Moore looked at him.
“Sorry,” Brüks said. “It’s just, you hear so much about the Bicamerals and their scientific breakthroughs and their quest for Truth. And I finally get inside this grand edifice and all I hear is Trust and God willing and Take it on faith. I mean, the whole order’s supposed to be founded on the search for knowledge, and Rule Number One is Don’t ask questions?”
“It’s not that they don’t have answers,” Moore said after a moment. “It’s just that we can’t understand them for the most part. You could resort to analogies, I suppose. Force transhuman insights into human cookie-cutter shapes. But most of the time that would just get you a bleeding metaphor with all its bones broken.” He held up a hand, warding off Brüks’s rejoinder. “I know, I know: it can be frustrating as hell. But people have an unfortunate habit of assuming they understand the reality just because they understood the analogy. You dumb down brain surgery enough for a preschooler to think he understands it, the little tyke’s liable to grab a microwave scalpel and start cutting when no one’s looking.”
“And yet.” Brüks glanced at the wall, where AEROSOL DELIVERY glowed in shades of yellow and orange. Where a murderous tornado had rampaged the night before. “They seem to solve their conflicts pretty much the same way as us retarded ol’ baselines.”
Moore smiled faintly. “That they do.” ^Page-61
.     .     .

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-62]]
He found Lianna back on the front steps, supper balanced on her knees, watching the sun go down. She looked back over her shoulder as he pushed through the door.
“I asked about your brain-boosters,” she said. “No luck. The assembly line’s booked or something.”
“Thanks for trying,” he said.
“Jim might still be holding. If you haven’t asked him already.”
He shifted his tray to one hand, used the other to rub away the vague pain behind his eyes. “Mind if I join you?”
She spared one hand to take in the staircase, as broad and excessive as a cathedral’s.
He sat beside her, picked at his own plate. “About this morning, I, uh…”
She stared at the horizon. The sun stared back, highlighting her cheekbones.
“… sorry,” he finished.
“Forget it. Nobody likes being in a cage.”
“Still. I shouldn’t have shot the messenger.” A sudden chilly breeze crawled across his shoulders.
Lianna shrugged. “You ask me, nobody should shoot anybody.”
He raised his eyes. Venus twinkled back at them. He wondered briefly if those photons had followed a straight line to his eyes, or if they’d been shunted around some invisible spillway of curves and angles at the last nanosecond. He looked around at the cracked desert floor, lifted his gaze to the more jagged topography in the distance. Wondered how many unseen agents were looking back.
“You always eat out here?”
“When I can.” The lowering sun stretched her shadow along the ramparts behind them, a giantess silhouetted in orange. “It’s—stark, you know?”
Ribbed clouds, a million shades of salmon, scudding against an orange and purple sky.
“How long does this go on?” he wondered. ^Page-62

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-63]]
“This?”
“They lurk out there, we wait in here. When does somebody actually make a move?”
“Oldschool, you gotta relax.” She shook her head, smiled a twilit smile. “You could obsess and second-guess for a solid month and I guarantee you wouldn’t be able to think of anything our hosts haven’t already factored five ways to Sunday. They’ve been making moves all day.”
“Such as?”
“Don’t ask me.” She shrugged. “I probably wouldn’t understand even if they told me. They’re wired up way differently.”
Hive mind, he reminded himself. Synesthetes, too, if he wasn’t mistaken.
“You do understand them, though,” he said. “That’s your job.”
“Not the way you think. And not without a fair bit of modding on my own.”
“How, then?”
“I’m not sure,” she admitted.
“Come on.”
“No, really. It’s a kind of Zen thing. Like playing the piano, or being a centipede in Heaven. The moment you start to think about what you’re doing, you screw up. You just have to get into the zone.”
“They must have trained you at some point,” Brüks insisted. “There must have been some kind of conscious learning curve.”
“You’d think so, wouldn’t you?” She squinted up at some invisible behemoth he still couldn’t see. “But they kind of—bypassed that. Zapped my fornix with just the right burst of ultrasound and next thing I know it’s four days later and I have all these reflexes. Not so much that I understand them as my fingers do, you know? Phonemes, rhythms, gestures—eye movements, sometimes—” She frowned. “I take in all these cues and equations just—come to me, piece by piece. I copy them down and I send ’em off. And the next day they show up in the latest issue of Science.” ^Page-63

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-64]]
“You never examined these reflexes afterward? Played the piano really slowly, taken the time to watch what your fingers were doing?”
“Dan, they won’t fit. Consciousness is a scratchpad. You can store a grocery list, jot down a couple of phone numbers—but were you even aware of finishing your supper?”
Brüks looked down at his plate. It was empty.
“And that’s just a couple of swallows half a minute in the past. You ever try holding, say, even a single chapter of a novel in your head? Consciously? All at once?” Her dreads swept back and forth in the gloom. “Whatever I’m doing, it’s got too many variables. Won’t fit in the global workspace.” She flashed him a small, apologetic smile.
They program us like clockwork dolls, he thought. Way off to the west, the sun touched gently down on a distant ridge.
He looked at her. “Why are we still in charge?”
She grinned. “Who’s we, white boy?”
He didn’t. “These people you—work for. They’re supposed to be helpless, that’s what everyone says. You can optimize a brain for down there or up here, not both. Anyone comfortable thinking at Planck scales, they can barely cross the street unassisted up in the real world. That’s why they set up in the desert. That’s why they have people like you. That’s what they tell us.”
“All true, more or less,” Lianna said.
He shook his head. “They micromanage tornadoes, Lee. They turn people into puppets with a wink and a wave, they own half the patent office. They’re about as helpless as a T. rex in a daycare center. So why haven’t they been running things for years?”
“That’s like a chimp asking why those hairless apes aren’t slinging bigger feces than everyone else, if they’re so damned clever.”
He tried not to smile, and failed. “That’s not really an answer.”
“Sure it is. Everybody goes on about hive mind this and synesthesia that like they were some kind of superpowers.”
“After last night, you’re going to tell me they’re not?”
“It goes so much deeper than that. It’s perceptual. We’re so— ^Page-65

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-65]]
impoverished, you know? We don’t look out at reality at all, we look in at this model, this caricature our brains cobble together out of wavelengths and pressure points. We squint down over handwritten notes that say two blocks east, turn left at the bridge and we think that reading those stupid scribbles is the same as seeing the universe passing by on the other side of the windshield.” She glanced over her shoulder, to the edifice at their backs.
Brüks frowned. “You think Bicamerals can see outside the windshield.”
“Dunno. Maybe.”
“Then I’ve got some bad news for you. Reality went out the window the moment we started mediating sensory input through a nervous system. You want to actually perceive the universe directly, without any stupid scribbles or model-building? Become a protozoan.”
A smile lit her face, startlingly bright in the deepening gloom. “Wouldn’t that be just like them. Build a group mind complex enough to put any hundred baseline geniuses to shame, and use it to think like a paramecium.”
“That wasn’t exactly my point,” he said.
The sun winked good-bye and slid below the horizon.
“I don’t know how they do it,” she admitted. “But if what they see is even closer to reality—well, that’s what you call transcendence. Not the ability to micromanage tornados, just—seeing a little more of what’s out there.” She tapped her temple. “Instead of what’s in here.”
She stood, stretched like a cat. Brüks rose beside her and brushed the desert from his clothes. “Then transcendence is out of reach. For our brains, anyway.”
Lianna shrugged. “Change your brain.”
“Then it’s not your brain anymore. It’s something else. You’re something else.”
“That’s kinda the point. Transcendence is transformation.”
He shook his head, unconvinced. “Sounds more like suicide to me.” ^Page-65

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-66]]
.   .   .
He felt his eyes start up under closed lids, stepped out onto that razor-thin line between dreamtime and the waking edge: just enough awareness to see the curtain, not enough to notice the man behind.
Lucid dreaming was a delicate exercise.
He sat up on the pallet, phantom legs still wearing corporeal ones like the abdomen of some half-molted insect. He looked around at furnishings that would have been spartan to anyone who hadn’t just spent two months sleeping on the desert floor: a raised sleeping pallet a couple of meters long, dipped in some softer, thicker variant of the fleshy synthetic lining the floors. An alcove in the wall, a medicine cabinet fronted with frosted glass. Another one of those washbasin pedestals, this one with a towel bar bolted to the side facing the bed: a hand towel draped over it. The cubby Luckett had tucked him into for the night, all pretty much the way it looked when he was awake.
He’d learned to launch his dreams from a platform anchored in reality. It made the return trip easier.
Brüks flexed his temporoparietal and ascended through a ceiling of polished granite (that was surmise—he’d forgotten to take note of its composition in the waking world). The monastery spread out around, then below him: dwindled from a life-size fortress to a tabletop model on a cracked gray moonscape. A fingernail moon shone bone-white overhead; everywhere else, a million stars glinted hard as ice crystals against the darkness.
He flew north.
It was minimalist magic: no rainbow bridges or talking clouds, no squadrons of aircraft piloted by tyrannosaurs. He’d long since learned not to strain the credulity of whatever mental processes indulged his presence here, critics that had lived in his head since before his dreams had even been lucid. Some inner skeptic frowned at the thought of a space-faring bicycle and dreaming eight-year-old Danny Brüks found himself stranded between the ^Page-66

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-4#^Page-67]]
stars. Some forebrain killjoy snorted at the giddy delight of flying and suddenly he was entangled in high-tension wires, or simply ejected back into consciousness at three in the morning, spat out of sleep by his own incredulity. Even in dreams, his brain had been selling him out since before he’d had hair on his crotch. As an adult he’d had no use for them until his limited baseline learning curve had run out of waking hours, forced him to learn new techniques in his sleep lest academia’s new-and-improving generation devoured him from behind.
He could fly now at least, without thought or self-subversion. He’d learned that much through years of practice, through the induction hardware that had once guided his visions when REM started up, through the exercises that eventually let him ditch those training wheels and do it all in his own head. He could fly, into orbit and beyond and back if he wanted to. He could fly all the way to Heaven. That was where he was going now: the Northern Lights swirled in the sky directly ahead, a blue-green curtain shimmering above his destination like a Star of Bethlehem for the Holographic Age.
But no talking clouds. He’d also learned not to push it.
Now, ghostlike, he passed through Heaven’s fortifications and descended into its deepest levels. Rho languished there as she always did, alone in her cell, still wearing the paper smock and slippers she’d worn in Departures when they’d told each other it wasn’t goodbye. A cuff around her left ankle and a dozen links of corroded chain shackled her to the wall. Hair hung across her downcast face like a dark curtain.
Her face lit up, though, as he descended through the ceiling.
He settled beside her on the stone floor. “I’m sorry. I would’ve come sooner, I just—”
He stopped. No point in wasting precious REM with dreamed apologies. He tweaked the script, started again.
“You wouldn’t believe what’s happening,” he said.
“Tell me.” ^Page-67

“I’ve got caught up in some kind of war, I’m trapped behind enemy lines with a bunch of—really. You wouldn’t believe me.”
“Monks and zombies,” she said. “And a vampire.”
Of course she knew.
“I don’t even know how I can be here. You’d think with all this stuff happening I’d be too wired to even sit down, but—”
“You’ve been going straight for twenty-four hours.” She laid her hand on his. “Of course you’re going to crash.”
“These people don’t,” he grumbled. “I don’t think they even sleep, not all at once anyway. Different parts of their brains take—shifts, or something. Like a bunch of dolphins.”
“You’re not a dolphin, and you’re not some augmented wannabe either. You’re natural. Just the way I like it. And you know what?”
“What?”
“You’re going to keep up with them. You always do.”
Not always, he thought.
“You should come back,” he said suddenly. Somewhere far away, his fingers and toes tingled faintly.
She shook her head. “We’ve been over this.”
“Nobody’s saying you have to go back to the job. There are a million other options.”
“In here,” she told him, “there are a billion.”
He looked at her chain. He had never consciously forged those links. He’d simply found her like this. He could have changed her circumstance with a thought, of course, as he could change anything in this world—but there were always risks.
He’d learned not to push it.
“You can’t like it here,” he said quietly.
She laughed. “Why not? I didn’t put that thing on.”
“But—” His temples throbbed. He willed them to stop.
“Dan,” she said gently, “You can keep up out there. I can’t.”
The tingling intensified in his extremities. Rho’s face wavered before him, fading to black. He couldn’t keep her together much longer. All this careful conservatism, these shackled environments ^Page-68

that barely edged beyond the laws of physics—they only guarded against the Inner Heckler, not these unwelcome sensations intruding from outside. Headaches. Pins and needles. They distracted from his own contrivance; suddenly the whole façade was falling apart around him. “Come back soon,” his wife called through the rising static. “I’ll be waiting…”
She was gone before he could answer. He tried to construct something spectacular—the implosion of Heaven itself, a fiery inward collapse toward some ravenous singularity deep below the Canadian Shield—but he was rising too fast toward the light.
There’d been a time when he’d derided his own lack of imagination, cursed his inability to slip his shackles and just dream like everyone else, with glorious hallucinogenic abandon. Even now, sometimes, he had to remind himself: it wasn’t a failing at all. It was a strength.
Even in sleep, Dan Brüks didn’t take anything on faith. ^Page-69
