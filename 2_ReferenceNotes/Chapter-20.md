"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you mad."
—Aldous Huxley
They'd hoped, by now, to have banished sleep forever.
The waste was nothing short of obscene: a third of every Human life spent with its strings cut,
insensate, the body burning fuel but not producing. Think of all we could accomplish if we didn't have
to lapse into unconsciousness every fifteen hours or so, if our minds could stay awake and alert from
the moment of infancy to that final curtain call a hundred twenty years later. Think of eight billion
souls with no off switch and no down time until the very chassis wore out.
Why, we could go to the stars.
It hadn't worked out that way. Even if we'd outgrown the need to stay quiet and hidden during the dark
hours—the only predators left were those we'd brought back ourselves—the brain still needed time
apart from the world outside. Experiences had to be catalogued and filed, mid-term memories
promoted to long-term ones, free radicals swept from their hiding places among the dendrites. We had
only reduced the need for sleep, not eliminated it—and that incompressible residue of downtime
seemed barely able to contain the dreams and phantoms left behind. They squirmed in my head like
creatures in a draining tidal pool.
I woke.
I was alone, weightless, in the center of my tent. I could have sworn something had tapped me on the
back. Leftover hallucination, I thought. A lingering aftereffect of the haunted mansion, going for one
last bit of gooseflesh en route to extinction.
But it happened again. I bumped against the keelward curve of the bubble, bumped again, head and
shoulder-blades against fabric; the rest of me came after, moving gently but irresistibly—
Down.
Theseus was accelerating.
No. Wrong direction. Theseus was rolling, like a harpooned whale at the surface of the sea. Turning
her belly to the stars.
I brought up ConSensus and threw a Nav-tac summary against the wall. A luminous point erupted
from the outline of our ship, crawled away from Big Ben leaving a bright filament etched in its wake.
I watched until the numbers read 15G.
"Siri. My quarters, please."
I jumped. It sounded as though the vampire had been at my very shoulder.
"Coming."
An ampsat relay, climbing at long last to an intercept with the Icarus antimatter stream. Somewhere
behind the call of duty, my heart sank.
We weren't running, Robert Cunningham's fondest wishes notwithstanding. Theseus was stockpiling
ordinance.

The open hatch gaped like a cave in the face of a cliff. The pale blue light from the spine couldn't
seem to reach inside. Sarasti was barely more than a silhouette, black on gray, his bright bloody eyes
reflecting catlike in the surrounding gloom.
"Come." He amped up the shorter wavelengths in deference to human vision. The interior of the
bubble brightened, although the light remained slightly red-shifted. Like Rorschach with high beams.
I floated into Sarasti's parlor. His face, normally paper-white, was so flushed it looked sunburned. He
gorged himself, I couldn't help thinking. He drank deep. But all that blood was his own. Usually he
kept it deep in the flesh, favoring the vital organs. Vampires were efficient that way. They only
washed out their peripheral tissues occasionally, when lactate levels got too high.
Or when they were hunting.
He had a needle to his throat, injected himself with three cc's of clear liquid as I watched. His
antiEuclideans. I wondered how often he had to replenish them, now that he'd lost faith in the
implants. He withdrew the needle and slipped it into a sheath geckoed to a convenient strut. His color
drained as I watched, sinking back to the core, leaving his skin waxy and corpselike.
"You're here as official observer," Sarasti said.
I observed. His quarters were even more spartan than mine. No personal effects to speak of. No
custom coffin lined with shrink-wrapped soil. Nothing but two jumpsuits, a pouch for toiletries, and a
disconnected fiberop umbilicus half as thick as my little finger, floating like a roundworm in
formalin. Sarasti's hardline to the Captain. Not even a cortical jack, I remembered. It plugged into the
medulla, the brainstem. That was logical enough; that was where all the neural cabling converged, the
point of greatest bandwidth. Still, it was a disquieting thought—that Sarasti linked to the ship through
the brain of a reptile.
An image flared on the wall, subtly distorted against the concave surface: Stretch and Clench in their
adjoining cells, rendered in splitscreen. Cryptic vitals defaced little grids below each image.
The distortion distracted me. I looked for a corrected feed in ConSensus, came up empty. Sarasti read
my expression: "Closed circuit."
By now the scramblers would have seemed sick and ragged even to a virgin audience. They floated
near the middle of their respective compartments, segmented arms drifting aimlessly back and forth.
Membranous patches of—skin, I suppose—were peeling from the cuticles, giving them a fuzzy,
decomposing aspect.
"The arms move continuously," Sarasti remarked. "Robert says it assists in circulation."
I nodded, watching the display.
"Creatures that move between stars can't even perform basic metabolic functions without constant
flailing." He shook his head. "Inefficient. Primitive."
I glanced at the vampire. He remained fixed on our captives.
"Obscene," he said, and moved his fingers.
A new window opened on the wall: the Rosetta protocol, initializing. Kilometers away, microwaves
flooded the holding tanks.
I reminded myself: No interference. Only observation.
However weakened their condition, the scramblers were not yet indifferent to pain. They knew the
game, they knew the rules; they dragged themselves to their respective panels and played for mercy.
Sarasti had simply invoked a step-by-step replay of some previous sequence. The scramblers went
through it all again, buying a few moments' intermittent respite with the same old proofs and
theorems.
Sarasti clicked, then spoke: "They regenerate these solutions faster than they did before. Do you think
they're acclimated to the microwaves?"
Another readout appeared on the display; an audio alarm began chirping somewhere nearby. I looked
at Sarasti, and back at the readout: a solid circle of turquoise backlit by a pulsing red halo. The shape
meant atmospheric anomaly. The color meant oxygen.
I felt a moment of confusion—(Oxygen? Why would oxygen set off the alarm?)—until I remembered:
Scramblers were anaerobes.
Sarasti muted the alarm with a wave of his hand.
I cleared my throat: "You're poisoning—"
"Watch. Performance is consistent. No change."
I swallowed. Just observe.
"Is this an execution?" I asked. "Is this a, a mercy killing?"
Sarasti looked past me, and smiled. "No."
I dropped my eyes. "What, then?"
He pointed at the display. I turned, reflexively obedient.
Something stabbed my hand like a spike at a crucifixion.
I screamed. Electric pain jolted to my shoulder. I yanked my hand back without thinking; the
embedded blade split its flesh like a fin through water. Blood sprayed into the air and stayed there, a
comet's tail of droplets tracing the frenzied arc of my hand.
Sudden scalding heat from behind. Flesh charred on my back. I screamed again, flailing. A veil of
bloody droplets swirled in the air.
Somehow I was in the corridor, staring dumbly at my right hand. It had been split to the heel of the
palm, flopped at the end of my wrist in two bloody, bifingered chunks. Blood welled from the torn
edges and wouldn't fall. Sarasti advanced through a haze of trauma and confusion. His face swam in
and out of focus, rich with his blood or mine. His eyes were bright red mirrors, his eyes were time
machines. Darkness roared around them and it was half a million years ago and I was just another
piece of meat on the African savannah, a split-second from having its throat torn out.
"Do you see the problem?" Sarasti asked, advancing. A great spider crab hovered at his shoulder. I
forced focus through the pain: one of Bates' grunts, taking aim. I kicked blindly, hit the ladder through
sheer happenstance, careened backwards down the corridor.
The vampire came after me, his face split into something that would have been a smile on anyone else.
"Conscious of pain, you're distracted by pain. You're fixated on it. Obsessed by the one threat, you
miss the other."
I flailed. Crimson mist stung my eyes.
"So much more aware, so much less perceptive. An automaton could do better."
He's snapped, I thought. He's insane. And then No, he's a transient. He's always been a transient—
"They could do better," he said softly.
—and he's been hiding for days. Deep down. Hiding from the seals.
What else would he do?
Sarasti raised his hands, fading in and out of focus. I hit something, kicked without aiming, bounced
away through swirling mist and startled voices. Metal cracked the back of my head and spun me
around.
A hole, a burrow. A place to hide. I dove through, my torn hand flapping like a dead fish against the
edge of the hatch. I cried out and tumbled into the drum, the monster at my heels.
Startled shouts, very close now. "This wasn't the plan, Jukka! This wasn't the goddamned plan!" That
was Susan James, full of outrage, while Amanda Bates snarled "Stand down, right fucking now!" and
leapt from the deck to do battle. She rose through the air, all overclocked reflexes and carboplatinum
augments but Sarasti just batted her aside and kept on coming. His arm shot out like a striking snake.
His hand clamped around my throat.
"Is this what you meant?" James cried from some dark irrelevant hiding place. "Is this your
preconditioning?"
Sarasti shook me. "Are you in there, Keeton?"
My blood splattered across his face like rain. I babbled and cried.
"Are you listening? Can you see?"
And suddenly I could. Suddenly everything clicked into focus. Sarasti wasn't talking at all. Sarasti
didn't even exist anymore. Nobody did. I was alone in a great spinning wheel surrounded by things
that were made out of meat, things that moved all by themselves. Some of them were wrapped in
pieces of cloth. Strange nonsensical sounds came from holes at their top ends, and there were other
things up there, bumps and ridges and something like marbles or black buttons, wet and shiny and
embedded in the slabs of meat. They glistened and jiggled and moved as if trying to escape.
I didn't understand the sounds the meat was making, but I heard a voice from somewhere. It was like
God talking, and that I couldn't help but understand.
"Get out of your room, Keeton," it hissed. "Stop transposing or interpolating or rotating or whatever it
is you do. Just listen. For once in your goddamned life, understand something. Understand that your
life depends on it. Are you listening, Keeton?"
And I cannot tell you what it said. I can only tell you what I heard.

You invest so much in it, don't you? It's what elevates you above the beasts of the field, it's what
makes you special. Homo sapiens, you call yourself. Wise Man. Do you even know what it is, this
consciousness you cite in your own exaltation? Do you even know what it's for?
Maybe you think it gives you free will. Maybe you've forgotten that sleepwalkers converse, drive
vehicles, commit crimes and clean up afterwards, unconscious the whole time. Maybe nobody's told
you that even waking souls are only slaves in denial.
Make a conscious choice. Decide to move your index finger. Too late! The electricity's already
halfway down your arm. Your body began to act a full half-second before your conscious self 'chose'
to, for the self chose nothing; something else set your body in motion, sent an executive summary—
almost an afterthought— to the homunculus behind your eyes. That little man, that arrogant
subroutine that thinks of itself as the person, mistakes correlation for causality: it reads the summary
and it sees the hand move, and it thinks that one drove the other.
But it's not in charge. You're not in charge. If free will even exists, it doesn't share living space with
the likes of you.
Insight, then. Wisdom. The quest for knowledge, the derivation of theorems, science and technology
and all those exclusively human pursuits that must surely rest on a conscious foundation. Maybe that's
what sentience would be for— if scientific breakthroughs didn't spring fully-formed from the
subconscious mind, manifest themselves in dreams, as full-blown insights after a deep night's sleep.
It's the most basic rule of the stymied researcher: stop thinking about the problem. Do something else.
It will come to you if you just stop being conscious of it.
Every concert pianist knows that the surest way to ruin a performance is to be aware of what the
fingers are doing. Every dancer and acrobat knows enough to let the mind go, let the body run itself.
Every driver of any manual vehicle arrives at destinations with no recollection of the stops and turns
and roads traveled in getting there. You are all sleepwalkers, whether climbing creative peaks or
slogging through some mundane routine for the thousandth time. You are all sleepwalkers.
Don't even try to talk about the learning curve. Don't bother citing the months of deliberate practice
that precede the unconscious performance, or the years of study and experiment leading up to the gift-
wrapped Eureka moment. So what if your lessons are all learned consciously? Do you think that
proves there's no other way? Heuristic software's been learning from experience for over a hundred
years. Machines master chess, cars learn to drive themselves, statistical programs face problems and
design the experiments to solve them and you think that the only path to learning leads through
sentience? You're Stone-age nomads, eking out some marginal existence on the veldt—denying even
the possibility of agriculture, because hunting and gathering was good enough for your parents.
Do you want to know what consciousness is for? Do you want to know the only real purpose it serves?
Training wheels. You can't see both aspects of the Necker Cube at once, so it lets you focus on one and
dismiss the other. That's a pretty half-assed way to parse reality. You're always better off looking at
more than one side of anything. Go on, try. Defocus. It's the next logical step.
Oh, but you can't. There's something in the way.
And it's fighting back.

Evolution has no foresight. Complex machinery develops its own agendas. Brains—cheat. Feedback
loops evolve to promote stable heartbeats and then stumble upon the temptation of rhythm and music.
The rush evoked by fractal imagery, the algorithms used for habitat selection, metastasize into art.
Thrills that once had to be earned in increments of fitness can now be had from pointless
introspection. Aesthetics rise unbidden from a trillion dopamine receptors, and the system moves
beyond modeling the organism. It begins to model the very process of modeling. It consumes ever-
more computational resources, bogs itself down with endless recursion and irrelevant simulations.
Like the parasitic DNA that accretes in every natural genome, it persists and proliferates and produces
nothing but itself. Metaprocesses bloom like cancer, and awaken, and call themselves I.
*
The system weakens, slows. It takes so much longer now to perceive—to assess the input, mull it over,
decide in the manner of cognitive beings. But when the flash flood crosses your path, when the lion
leaps at you from the grasses, advanced self-awareness is an unaffordable indulgence. The brain stem
does its best. It sees the danger, hijacks the body, reacts a hundred times faster than that fat old man
sitting in the CEO's office upstairs; but every generation it gets harder to work around this— this
creaking neurological bureaucracy.
I wastes energy and processing power, self-obsesses to the point of psychosis. Scramblers have no
need of it, scramblers are more parsimonious. With simpler biochemistries, with smaller brains—
deprived of tools, of their ship, even of parts of their own metabolism—they think rings around you.
They hide their language in plain sight, even when you know what they're saying. They turn your own
cognition against itself. They travel between the stars. This is what intelligence can do, unhampered
by self-awareness.
I is not the working mind, you see. For Amanda Bates to say "I do not exist" would be nonsense; but
when the processes beneath say the same thing, they are merely reporting that the parasites have died.
They are only saying that they are free.
