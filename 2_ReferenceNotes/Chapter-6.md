"The glass ceiling is in you. The glass ceiling is conscience."
—Jacob Holtzbrinck, The Keys to the Planet
There were stories, before we left Earth, of a fourth wave: a fleet of deep-space dreadnoughts running
silent in our wake, should the cannon fodder up front run into something nasty. Or, if the aliens were
friendly, an ambassadorial frigate full of politicians and CEOs ready to elbow their way to the front of
the line. Never mind that Earth had no deep-space dreadnoughts or ambassadorial spaceships; Theseus
hadn't existed either, before Firefall. Nobody had told us of any such such contingent, but you never
show the Big Picture to your front line. The less they know, the less they can betray.
I still don't know if the fourth wave ever existed. I never saw any evidence of one, for whatever that's
worth. We might have left them floundering back at Burns-Caulfield. Or maybe they followed us all
the way to Big Ben, crept just close enough to see what we were up against, and turned tail before
things got ugly.
I wonder if that's what happened. I wonder if they made it back home.
I look back now, and hope not. ^Page-94

[[Chapter-6#^Page-95]] 
A giant marshmallow kicked Theseus in the side. Down swung like a pendulum. Across the drum
Szpindel yelped as if scalded; in the galley, cracking a bulb of hot coffee, I nearly was.
This is it, I thought. We got too close. They're hitting back.
"What the—"
A flicker on the party line as Bates linked from the bridge. "Main drive just kicked in. We're changing
course."
"To what? Where? Whose orders?"
"Mine," Sarasti said, appearing above us.
Nobody spoke. Drifting into the drum through the stern hatchway: the sound of something grinding. I
pinged Theseus' resource-allocation stack. Fabrication was retooling itself for the mass production of
doped ceramics.
Radiation shielding. Solid stuff, bulky and primitive, not the controlled magnetic fields we usually
relied on.
The Gang emerged sleepy-eyed from their tent, Sascha grumbling, "What the fuck?"
"Watch." Sarasti took hold of ConSensus and shook it.
It was a blizzard, not a briefing: gravity wells and orbital trajectories, shear-stress simulations in
thunderheads of ammonium and hydrogen, stereoscopic planetscapes buried under filters ranging from
gamma to radio. I saw breakpoints and saddlepoints and unstable equilibria. I saw fold catastrophes
plotted in five dimensions. My augments strained to rotate the information; my meaty half-brain
struggled to understand the bottom line.
Something was hiding down there, in plain sight.
Ben's accretion belt still wasn't behaving. Its delinquency wasn't obvious; Sarasti hadn't had to plot
every pebble and mountain and planetesimal to find the pattern, but he'd come close. And neither he
nor the conjoined intelligence he shared with the Captain had been able to explain those trajectories as
the mere aftermath of some past disturbance. The dust wasn't just settling; some of it ^Page-95

[[Chapter-6#^Page-96]] 
marched
downhill to the beat of something that even now reached out from the cloud-tops and pulled debris
from orbit.
Not all that debris seemed to hit. Ben's equatorial regions flickered constantly with the light of
meteorite impacts—much fainter than the bright wakes of the skimmers, and gone in the wink of an
eye—but those frequency distributions didn't quite account for all the rocks that had fallen. It was
almost as though, every now and then, some piece of incoming detritus simply vanished into a parallel
universe.
Or got caught by something in this one. Something that circled Ben's equator every forty hours, almost
low enough to graze the atmosphere. Something that didn't show up in visible light, or infrared, or
radar. Something that might have remained pure hypothesis if a skimmer hadn't burned an
incandescent trail across the atmosphere behind it when Theseus happened to be watching.
Sarasti threw that one dead center: a bright contrail streaking diagonally across Ben's perpetual
nightscape, stuttering partway a degree or two to the left, stuttering back just before it passed from
sight. Freeze-frame showed a beam of light frozen solid, a segment snapped from its midsection and
jiggled just a hair out of alignment.
A segment nine kilometers long.
"It's cloaked," Sascha said, impressed.
"Not very well." Bates emerged from the forward hatch and sailed spinward. "Pretty obvious
refractory artefact." She caught stairs halfway to the deck, used the torque of spin-against-spam to flip
upright and plant her feet on the steps. "Why didn't we catch that before?"
"No backlight," Szpindel suggested.
"It's not just the contrail. Look at the clouds." Sure enough, Ben's cloudy backdrop showed the same
subtle dislocation. Bates stepped onto the deck and headed for the conference table. "We should've
seen this earlier."
"The other probes see no such artefact," Sarasti said. "This probe approaches from a wider angle.
Twenty-seven degrees."
"Wider angle to what?" Sascha said. ^Page-96

[[Chapter-6#^Page-97]] 
"To the line," Bates murmured. "Between us and them."
It was all there on tactical: Theseus fell inwards along an obvious arc, but the probes we'd dispatched
hadn't dicked around with Hohmann transfers: they'd burned straight down, their courses barely
bending, all within a few degrees of the theoretical line connecting Ben to Theseus.
Except this one. This one had come in wide, and seen the trickery.
"The further from our bearing, the more obvious the discontinuity," Sarasti intoned. "Think it's clearly
visible on any approach perpendicular to ours."
"So we're in a blind spot? We see it if we change course?"
Bates shook her head. "The blind spot's moving, Sascha. It's—"
"Tracking us." Sascha sucked breath between her teeth. "Motherfucker."
Szpindel twitched. "So what is it? Our skimmer factory?"
The freeze-frame's pixels began to crawl. Something emerged, granular and indistinct, from the
turbulent swirls and curlicues of Ben's atmosphere. There were curves, and spikes, and no smooth
edges; I couldn't tell how much of the shape was real, and how much a fractal intrusion of underlying
cloudscape. But the overall outline was that of a torus, or perhaps a collection of smaller jagged things
piled together in a rough ring; and it was big. Those nine klicks of displaced contrail had merely
grazed the perimeter, cut across an arc of forty or fifty degrees. This thing hiding in the shadow of ten
Jupiters was almost thirty kilometers from side to side.
Sometime during Sarasti's executive summary we'd stopped accellerating. Down was back where it
belonged. We weren't, though. Our hesitant maybe-maybe-not approach was a thing of the past: we
vectored straight in now, and damn the torpedoes.
"Er, that's thirty klicks across," Sascha pointed out. "And it's invisible. Shouldn't we maybe be a little
more cautious now?"
Szpindel shrugged. "We could second-guess vampires, we wouldn't need vampires, eh?" ^Page-97

[[Chapter-6#^Page-98]] 
A new facet bloomed on the feed. Frequency histograms and harmonic spectra erupted from flatline
into shifting mountainscapes, a chorus of visible light.
"Modulated laser," Bates reported.
Szpindel looked up. "From that?"
Bates nodded. "Right after we blow its cover. Interesting timing."
"Scary timing," Szpindel said. "How'd it know?"
"We changed course. We're heading right for it."
The lightscape played on, knocking at the window.
"Whatever it is," Bates said, "it's talking to us."
"Well then," remarked a welcome voice. "By all means let's say hello."
Susan James was back in the driver's seat.
I was the only pure spectator.
They all performed what duties they could. Szpindel ran Sarasti's sketchy silhouette through a series
of filters, perchance to squeeze a bit of biology from engineering. Bates compared morphometrics
between the cloaked artefact and the skimmers. Sarasti watched us all from overhead and thought
vampire thoughts deeper than anything we could aspire to. But it was all just make-work. The Gang of
Four was on center stage, under the capable direction of Susan James.
She grabbed the nearest chair, sat, raised her hands as if cueing an orchestra. Her fingers trembled in
mid-air as she played virtual icons; her lips and jaw twitched with subvocal commands. I tapped her
feed and saw text accreting around the alien signal:
Rorschach to vessel approaching 116Az -23dec rel. Hello Theseus. Rorschach to vessel
approaching 116Az -23dec rel. Hello Theseus. Rorschach to vessel approachi ^Page-98

[[Chapter-6#^Page-99]] 
She'd decoded the damn thing. Already. She was even answering it:
Theseus to Rorschach. Hello Rorschach.
Hello Theseus. Welcome to the neighborhood.
She'd had less than three minutes. Or rather, they'd had less than three minutes: four fully-conscious
hub personalities and a few dozen unconscious semiotic modules, all working in parallel, all
exquisitely carved from the same lump of gray matter. I could almost see why someone would do such
deliberate violence to their own minds, if it resulted in this kind of performance.
Up to now I had never fully convinced myself that even survival was sufficient cause.
Request permission to approach, the Gang sent. Simple and straightforward: just facts and data, thank
you, with as little room as possible for ambiguity and misunderstanding. Fancy sentiments like we
come in peace could wait. A handshake was not the time for cultural exchange.
You should stay away. Seriously. This place is dangerous.
That got some attention. Bates and Szpindel hesitated momentarily in their own headspaces and
glanced into James'.
Request information on danger, the gang sent back. Still keeping it concrete.
Too close and dangerous to you. low orbit complications.
Request information on low orbit complications.
Lethal environment. Rocks and rads. You're welcome. I can take it but we're like that. ^Page-99

[[Chapter-6#^Page-100]] 
We are aware of the rocks in low orbit. We are equipped to deal with radiation. Request
information on other hazards.
I dug under the transcript to the channel it fed from. Theseus had turned part of the incoming beam
into a sound wave, according to the color code. Vocal communication, then. They spoke. Waiting
behind that icon were the raw sounds of an alien language.
Of course I couldn't resist.
"Anytime between friends, right? Are you here for the celebration?"
English. The voice was human, male. Old.
"We are here to explore," replied the Gang, although their voice was pure Theseus. "Request dialog
with agents who sent objects into near-solar space."
"First contact. Sounds like something to celebrate."
I double-checked the source. No, this wasn't a translation; this was the actual unprocessed signal
coming from—Rorschach, it had called itself. Part of the signal, anyway; there were other elements,
nonacoustic ones, encoded in the beam.
I browsed them while James said, "Request information about your celebration": standard ship-to-ship
handshaking protocols.
"You're interested." The voice was stronger now, younger.
"Yes."
"You are?"
"Yes," the Gang repeated patiently.
"You are?"
The slightest hesitation. "This is Theseus."
"I know that, baseline." In Mandarin, now. "Who are you?"
No obvious change in the harmonics. Somehow, though, the voice seemed to have acquired an edge.
"This is Susan James. I am a—"
"You wouldn't be happy here, Susan. Fetishistic religious beliefs involved. There are dangerous
observances." ^Page-100

[[Chapter-6#^Page-101]] 
James chewed her lip.
"Request clarification. Are we in danger from these observances?"
"You certainly could be."
"Request clarification. Is it the observances that are dangerous, or the low-orbit environment?"
"The environment of the disturbances. You should pay attention, Susan. Inattention connotes
indifference," Rorschach said.
"Or disrespect," it added after a moment.
We had four hours before Ben got in the way. Four hours of uninterrupted nonstop communication
made vastly easier than anyone had expected. It spoke our language, after all. Repeatedly it expressed
polite concern for our welfare. And yet, for all its facility with Human speech it told us very little. For
four hours it managed to avoid giving a straight answer on any subject beyond the extreme
inadvisability of closer contact, and by the time it fell into eclipse we still didn't know why.
Sarasti dropped onto the deck halfway through the exchange, his feet never touching the stairs. He
reached out and grabbed a railing to steady himself on landing, and staggered only briefly. If I'd tried
that I'd have ended up bouncing along the deck like a pebble in a cement mixer.
He stood still as stone for the rest of the session, face motionless, eyes hidden behind his onyx visor.
When Rorschach's signal faded in midsentence he assembled us around the Commons table with a
gesture.
"It talks," he said.
James nodded. "It doesn't say much, except for asking us to keep our distance. So far the voice has
manifested as adult male, although the apparent age changed a few times."
He'd heard all that. "Structure?"
"The ship-to-ship protocols are perfect. Its vocabulary is far ^Page-101

[[Chapter-6#^Page-102]] 
greater than you could derive from
standard nav chatter between a few ships, so they've been listening to all our insystem traffic—I'd say
for several years at least. On the other hand, the vocabulary doesn't have anywhere near the range
you'd get by monitoring entertainment multimede, so they probably arrived after the Broadcast Age."
"How well do they use the vocabulary they have?"
"They're using phrase-structure grammar, long-distance dependencies. FLN recursion, at least four
levels deep and I see no reason why it won't go deeper with continued contact. They're not parrots,
Jukka. They know the rules. That name, for example—"
"Rorschach," Bates murmered, knuckles cracking as she squeezed her pet ball. "Interesting choice."
"I checked the registry. There's an I-CAN freighter called Rorschach on the Martian Loop. Whoever
we're talking to must regard their own platform the way we'd regard a ship, and picked one of our
names to fit."
Szpindel dropped into the chair beside me, fresh from a galley run. A bulb of coffee glistened like
gelatin in his hand. "That name, out of all the ships in the innersys? Seems way too symbolic for a
random choice."
"I don't think it was random. Unusual ship names provoke comment; Rorschach's pilot goes ship-to-
ship with some other vessel, the other vessel comes back with oh Grandma, what an unusual name you
have, Rorschach replies with some off-the-cuff comment about nomenclatural origins and it all goes
out in the EM. Someone listening to all that chatter not only figures out the name and the thing it
applies to, but can get some sense of meaning from the context. Our alien friends probably
eavesdropped on half the registry and deduced that Rorschach would be a better tag for something
unfamiliar than, say, the SS Jaymie Matthews."
"Territorial and smart." Szpindel grimaced, conjuring a mug from beneath his chair. "Wonderful." ^Page-102

[[Chapter-6#^Page-103]] 
Bates shrugged. "Territorial, maybe. Not necessarily aggressive. In fact, I wonder if they could hurt us
even if they wanted to."
"I don't," Szpindel said. "Those skimmers—"
The major waved a dismissive hand. "Big ships turn slowly. If they were setting up to snooker us we'd
see it well in advance." She looked around the table. "Look, am I the only one who finds this odd? An
interstellar technology that redecorates superJovians and lines up meteoroids like elephants on parade,
and they were hiding? From us?"
"Unless there's someone else out here," James suggested uneasily.
Bates shook her head. "The cloak was directional. It was aimed at us and no one else."
"And even we saw through it," Szpindel added.
"Exactly. So they go to Plan B, which so far amounts to nothing but bluster and vague warnings. I'm
just saying, they're not acting like giants. Rorschach's behavior feels—improvised. I don't think they
expected us."
"'Course not. Burns-Caulfield was—"
"I don't think they expected us yet."
"Um," Szpindel said, digesting it.
The major ran one hand over her naked scalp. "Why would they expect us to just give up after we
learned we'd been sniped? Of course we'd look elsewhere. Burns-Caulfield could only have been
intended as a delaying action; if I was them, I'd plan on us getting out here eventually. But I think they
miscalculated somehow. We got out here sooner than they expected and caught them with their pants
down."
Szpindel split the bulb and emptied it into his mug. "Pretty large miscalculation for something so
smart, eh?" A hologram bloomed on contact with the steaming liquid, glowing in soft commemoration
of the Gaza Glasslands. The scent of plasticised coffee flooded the Commons. "Especially after they'd
surveilled us down to the square meter," he added. ^Page-103

[[Chapter-6#^Page-104]] 
"And what did they see? I-CANNs. Solar sails. Ships that take years to reach the Kuiper, and don't
have the reserves to go anywhere else afterwards. Telematter didn't exist beyond Boeing's simulators
and a half-dozen protypes back then. Easy to miss. They must've figured one decoy would buy them
all the time they needed."
"To do what?" James wondered.
"Whatever it is," Bates said, "We're ringside."
Szpindel raised his mug with an infirm hand and sipped. The coffee trembled in its prison, the surface
wobbling and blobbing in the drum's half-hearted gravity. James pursed her lips in faint disapproval.
Open-topped containers for liquids were technically verboten in variable-gravity environments, even
for people without Szpindel's dexterity issues.
"So they're bluffing," Szpindel said at last.
Bates nodded. "That's my guess. Rorschach's still under construction. We could be dealing with an
automated system of some kind."
"So we can ignore the keep-off-the-grass signs, eh? Walk right in."
"We can afford to bide our time. We can afford to not push it."
"Ah. So even though we could maybe handle it now, you want to wait until it graduates from covert to
invulnerable." Szpindel shuddered, set down his coffee. "Where'd you get your military training
again? Sporting Chance Academy?"
Bates ignored the jibe. "The fact that Rorschach's still growing may be the best reason to leave it alone
for a while. We don't have any idea what the—mature, I guess—what the mature form of this artefact
might be. Sure, it hid. Lots of animals take cover from predators without being predators, especially
young ones. Sure, it's—evasive. Doesn't give us the answers we want. But maybe it doesn't know them,
did you consider that? How much luck would you have interrogating a Human embryo? Adult could be
a whole different animal."
"Adult could put our asses through a meatgrinder." ^Page-104

[[Chapter-6#^Page-105]] 
"So could the embryo for all we know." Bates rolled her eyes. "Jesus, Isaac, you're the biologist. I
shouldn't have to tell you how many shy reclusive critters pack a punch when they're cornered.
Porcupine doesn't want any trouble, but he'll still give you a faceful of quills if you ignore the
warning."
Szpindel said nothing. He slid his coffee sideways along the concave tabletop, to the very limit of his
reach. The liquid sat there in its mug, a dark circle perfectly parallel to the rim but canted slightly
towards us. I even thought I could make out the merest convexity in the surface itself.
Szpindel smiled faintly at the effect.
James cleared her throat. "Not to downplay your concerns, Isaac, but we've hardly exhausted the
diplomatic route. And at least it's willing to talk, even if it's not as forthcoming as we'd like."
"Sure it talks," Szpindel said, eyes still on the leaning mug. "Not like us."
"Well, no. There's some—"
"It's not just slippery, it's downright dyslexic sometimes, you noticed? And it mixes up its pronouns."
"Given that it picked up the language entirely via passive eavesdropping, it's remarkably fluent. In
fact, from what I can tell they're more efficient at processing speech than we are."
"Gotta be efficient at a language if you're going to be so evasive in it, eh?"
"If they were human I might agree with you," James replied. "But what appears to us as evasion or
deceit could just as easily be explained by a reliance on smaller conceptual units."
"Conceptual units?" Bates, I was beginning to realize, never pulled up a subtitle if she could help it.
James nodded. "Like processing a line of text word by word, instead of looking at complete phrases.
The smaller the units, the faster they can be reconfigured; it gives you very fast semantic reflexes. The
down side is that it's difficult to maintain the same level ^Page-105

[[Chapter-6#^Page-106]] 
of logical consistency, since the patterns
within the larger structure are more likely to get shuffled."
"Whoa." Szpindel straightened, all thoughts of liquids and centipetal force forgotten.
"All I'm saying is, we aren't necessarily dealing with deliberate deception here. An entity who parses
information at one scale might not be aware of inconsistencies on another; it might not even have
conscious access to that level."
"That's not all you're saying."
"Isaac, you can't apply Human norms to a—"
"I wondered what you were up to." Szpindel dove into the transcripts. A moment later he dredged up
an excerpt:
Request information on environments you consider lethal. Request information on your
response to the prospect of imminent exposure to lethal environments.
Glad to comply. But your lethal is different from us. there are many migrating circumstances.
"You were testing it!" Szpindel crowed. He smacked his lips; his jaw ticced. You were looking for an
emotional response!"
"It was just a thought. It didn't prove anything."
"Was there a difference? In the response time?"
James hesitated, then shook her head. "But it was a stupid idea. There are so many variables, we have
no idea how they—I mean, they're alien..."
"The pathology's classic."
"What pathology?" I asked.
"It doesn't mean anything except that they're different from the Human baseline," James insisted.
"Which is not something anyone here can look down their nose about."
I tried again: "What pathology?" ^Page-106

[[Chapter-6#^Page-107]] 
James shook her head. Szpindel filled me in: "There's a syndrome you might have heard about, eh?
Fast talkers, no conscience, tend to malapropism and self-contradiction. No emotional affect."
"We're not talking about human beings here," James said again, softly.
"But if we were," Szpindel added, "we might call Rorschach a clinical sociopath."
Sarasti had said nothing during this entire exchange. Now, with the word hanging out in the open, I
noticed that nobody else would look at him.
We all knew that Jukka Sarasti was a sociopath, of course. Most of us just didn't mention it in polite
company.
Szpindel was never that polite. Or maybe it was just that he seemed to almost understand Sarasti; he
could look behind the monster and regard the organism, no less a product of natural selection for all
the human flesh it had devoured in eons past. That perspective calmed him, somehow. He could watch
Sarasti watching him, and not flinch.
"I feel sorry for the poor son of a bitch," he said once, back in training.
Some would have thought that absurd. This man, so massively interfaced with machinery that his own
motor skills had degraded for want of proper care and feeding; this man who heard x-rays and saw in
shades of ultrasound, so corrupted by retrofits he could no longer even feel his own fingertips without
assistance—this man could pity anyone else, let alone an infra-eyed predator built to murder without
the slightest twitch of remorse?
"Empathy for sociopaths isn't common," I remarked.
"Maybe it should be. We, at least—" he waved an arm; some remote-linked sensor cluster across the
simulator whirred and torqued reflexively— "chose the add-ons. Vampires had to be sociopaths. ^Page-107

[[Chapter-6#^Page-108]] 
They're too much like their own prey—a lot of taxonomists don't even consider them a subspecies,
you know that? Never diverged far enough for complete reproductive isolation. So maybe they're more
syndrome than race. Just a bunch of obligate cannibals with a consistent set of deformities."
"And how does that make—"
"If the only thing you can eat is your own kind, empathy is gonna be the first thing that goes.
Psychopathy's no disorder in those shoes, eh? Just a survival strategy. But they still make our skin
crawl, so we—chain 'em up."
"You think we should've repaired the Crucifix glitch?" Everyone knew why we hadn't. Only a fool
would resurrect a monster without safeguards in place. Vampires came with theirs built in: without his
antiEuclideans Sarasti would go grand mal the first time he caught close sight of a four-panel window
frame.
But Szpindel was shaking his head. "We couldn't have fixed it. Or we could have," he amended, "but
the glitch is in the visual cortex, eh? Linked to their omnisavantism. You fix it, you disable their
pattern-matching skills, and then what's the point in even bringing them back?"
"I didn't know that."
"Well, that's the official story." He fell silent a moment, cracked a crooked grin. "Then again, we
didn't have any trouble fixing the protocadherin pathways when it suited us."
I subtitled. Context-sensitive, ConSensus served up protocadherin γ-Y: the magical hominid brain
protein that vampires had never been able to synthesize. The reason they hadn't just switched to zebras
or warthogs once denied Human prey, why our discovery of the terrible secret of the Right Angle had
spelled their doom.
"Anyway, I just think he's—cut off." A nervous tic tugged at the corner of Szpindel's mouth. "Lone
wolf, nothing but sheep for company. Wouldn't you feel lonely?"
"They don't like company," I reminded him. You didn't put ^Page-108

[[Chapter-6#^Page-109]] 
vampires of the same sex together, not
unless you were taking bets on a bloodbath. They were solitary hunters and very territorial. With a
minimum viable pred-prey ratio of one to ten—and human prey spread so sparsely across the
Pleistocene landscape—the biggest threat to their survival had been competition from their own kind.
Natural selection had never taught them to play nicely together.
That didn't cut any ice with Szpindel, though. "Doesn't mean he can't be lonely," he insisted.
"Just means he can't fix it."^Page-109
