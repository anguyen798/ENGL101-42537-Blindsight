* [[Imagine you are Siri Keeton]]:
* Vampires did this all the time, you remember. It was normal for
them, it was their own unique take on resource conservation. They
could have taught your kind a few things about restraint, if that
absurd aversion to right-angles hadn't done them in at the dawn of
civilization. Maybe they still can. They're back now, after all—
raised from the grave with the voodoo of paleogenetics, stitched
together from junk genes and fossil marrow steeped in the blood of
sociopaths and high-functioning autistics. One of them commands
this very mission. A handful of his genes live on in your own body
so it too can rise from the dead, here at the edge of interstellar
space. 
* Nobody gets past Jupiter without becoming part vampire.
* If you did, of course—if you forgot appearance and watched for
motion, ignored meat and studied topology—you'd never mistake
one for another. Every facial tic was a data point, every
conversational pause spoke volumes more than the words to either
side. I could see James' personae shatter and coalesce in the flutter
of an eyelash. Szpindel's unspoken distrust of Amanda Bates
shouted from the corner of his smile. Every twitch of the
phenotype cried aloud to anyone who knew the language.
* And some things you kept to yourself. Not many baselines felt comfortable locking stares with a vampire—Sarasti, ever courteous, tended to avoid eye contact for exactly that reason—but there were other surfaces to his topology, just as mammalian and just as readable. If he had withdrawn from public view, maybe I was the reason. Maybe he was keeping secrets.
* Teleportation isn't magic: the Icarus
stream couldn't send us the actual antimatter it made, only the
quantum specs. Theseus had to filterfeed the raw material from
space, one ion at a time. For long dark years she'd made do on
pure inertia, hording every swallowed atom. Then a flip; ionizing
lasers strafing the space ahead; a ramscoop thrown wide in a hard
brake. The weight of a trillion trillion protons slowed her down
and refilled her gut and flattened us all over again. Theseus had
burned relentless until almost the moment of our resurrection.
* Or Theseus herself, for that matter. It was easy to forget
the Quantical AI at the heart of our ship. It stayed so discreetly in
the background, nurtured and carried us and permeated our
existence like an unobtrusive God; but like God, it never took your
calls.
