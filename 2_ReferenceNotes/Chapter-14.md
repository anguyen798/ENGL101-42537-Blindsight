"My genes done gone and tricked my brain
By making fucking feel so great
That's how the little creeps attain
Their plan to fuckin' replicate
But brain's got tricks itself, you see
To get the bang but not the bite
I got this here vasectomy
My genes can fuck themselves tonight."
—The r-selectors, Trunclade
First-person sex—real sex, as Chelsea insisted on calling it—was an acquired taste: jagged breathing,
the raw slap and stink of sweaty skin full of pores and blemishes, a whole other person with a whole
other set of demands and dislikes. There was definite animal appeal, no doubt about it. This was, after
all, how we'd done it for millions of years. But this, this third-world carnality had always carried an
element of struggle, of asynchronous patterns in conflict. There was no convergence here. There was
only the rhythm of bodies in collision, a struggle for dominance, each trying to force the other into
synch.
Chelsea regarded it as love in its purest form. I came to think of it as hand-to-hand combat. Before,
whether fucking creations from my own menu or slip-on skins from someone else's, I had always
selected the contrast and the rez, the texture and the attitude. The bodily functions, the resistance of
competing desires, the endless foreplay that wears your tongue to the root and leaves your face sticky
and glistening—just kinks, today. Options for the masochistic.
But there were no options with Chelsea. With her, everything came standard.
I indulged her. I guess I was no more patient with her perversions than she was with my ineptitude at
them. Other things made ^Page-209

[[Chapter-14#^Page-210]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-210
it worth the effort. Chelsea would argue about anything under the sun, wry
and insightful and curious as a cat. She would pounce without warning. Retired to the redundant
majority, she still took such simple joy in the very act of being alive. She was impulsive and
impetuous. She cared about people. Pag. Me. She wanted to know me. She wanted in.
That was proving to be a problem.
"We could try it again," she said once in an aftermath of sweat and pheromones. "And you won't even
remember what you were so upset about. You won't even remember you were upset, if you don't want
to."
I smiled and looked away; suddenly the planes of her face were coarse and unappealing. "How many
times is that now? Eight? Nine?"
"I just want you to be happy, Cyg. True happiness is one hell of a gift, and I can give it to you if you'll
let me."
"You don't want me happy," I said pleasantly. "You want me customized."
She mmm'd into the hollow of my throat for a moment. Then: "What?"
"You just want to change me into something more, more accommodating."
Chelsea lifted her head. "Look at me."
I turned my head. She'd shut down the chromatophores in her cheek; the tattoo, transplanted, fluttered
now on her shoulder.
"Look at my eyes," Chelsea said.
I looked at the imperfect skin around them, at the capillaries wriggling across the whites. I felt a
distant bemusement that such flawed, decaying organs were still able to hypnotize me on occasion.
"Now," Chelsea said. "What do you mean by that?"
I shrugged. "You keep pretending this is a partnership. We both know it's a competition." ^Page-210

[[Chapter-14#^Page-211]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-211
"A competition."
"You're trying to manipulate me into playing by your rules."
"What rules?"
"The way you want the relationship run. I don't blame you, Chelse, not in the least. We've been trying
to manipulate each other for as long as—hell, it's not even Human nature. It's mammalian."
"I don't believe it." She shook her head. Ropy tendrils of hair swung across her face. "It's the middle of
the twenty-first Century and you're hitting me with this war of the sexes bullshit?"
"Granted, your tweaks are a pretty radical iteration. Get right in there and reprogram your mate for
optimum servility."
"You actually think I'm trying to, to housebreak you? You think I'm trying to train you like a puppy?"
"You're just doing what comes naturally."
"I can't believe you'd pull this shit on me."
"I thought you valued honesty in relationships."
"What relationship? According to you there's no such thing. This is just—mutual rape, or something."
"That's what relationships are."
"Don't pull that shit on me." She sat up, swung her feet over the edge of the bed. Putting her back to
me. "I know how I feel. If I know anything I know that much. And I only wanted to make you happy."
"I know you believe that," I said gently. "I know it doesn't feel like a strategy. Nothing does when it's
wired that deeply. It just feels right, it feels natural. It's nature's trick."
"It's someone's fucking trick."
I sat up next to her, let my shoulder brush hers. She leaned away.
"I know this stuff," I said after a while. "I know how people work. It's my job."
It was hers too, for that matter. Nobody who spliced brains for a living could possibly be unaware of
all that basic wiring in the ^Page-211

[[Chapter-14#^Page-212]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-212
sub-basement. Chelsea had simply chosen to ignore it; to have admitted
anything would have compromised her righteous anger.
I could have pointed that out too, I suppose, but I knew how much stress the system could take and I
wasn't ready to test it to destruction. I didn't want to lose her. I didn't want to lose that feeling of
safety, that sense that it made a difference whether I lived or died. I only wanted her to back off a bit. I
only wanted room to breathe.
"You can be such a reptile sometimes," she said.
Mission accomplished.
*
Our first approach had been all caution and safety margins. This time we came in like a strike force.
Scylla burned towards Rorschach at over two gees, its trajectory a smooth and predictable arc ending
at the ruptured base camp. It may have even landed there, for all I know; perhaps Sarasti had two-
birded the mission, programmed the shuttle for some collecting of its own. If so, it wouldn't land with
us on board. Scylla spat us into space almost fifty kilometers short of the new beachhead, left us naked
and plummeting on some wireframe contraption with barely enough reaction mass for a soft landing
and a quick getaway. We didn't even have control over that: success depended on unpredictability, and
how better to ensure that than to not even know ourselves what we were doing?
Sarasti's logic. Vampire logic. We could follow it partway: the colossal deformation that had sealed
Rorschach's breach was so much slower, so much more expensive than the dropgate that had trapped
the Gang. The fact that dropgates hadn't been used implied that they took time to deploy—to
redistribute necessary mass, perhaps, or spring-load its reflexes. That gave us a window. We could
still venture into the den so long as the lions couldn't predict our ^Page-212

[[Chapter-14#^Page-213]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-213
destination and set traps in advance.
So long as we got out again before they could set them afterwards.
"Thirty-seven minutes," Sarasti had said, and none of us could fathom how he'd come to that number.
Only Bates had dared to ask aloud, and he had merely glinted at her: "You can't follow."
Vampire logic. From an obvious premise to an opaque conclusion. Our lives depended on it.
The retros followed some preprogrammed algorithm that mated Newton with a roll of the dice. Our
vector wasn't completely random—once we'd eliminated raceways and growth zones, areas without
line-of-sight escape routes, dead ends and unbranched segments ("Boring," Sarasti said, dismissing
them), barely ten percent of the artefact remained in the running. Now we dropped towards a warren of
brambles eight kilometers from our original landing site. Here in the midst of our final approach,
there was no way that even we could predict our precise point of impact.
If Rorschach could, it deserved to win.
We fell. Ridged spires and gnarled limbs sectioned the sky wherever I looked, cut the distant starscape
and the imminent superJovian into a jagged mosaic veined in black. Three kilometers away or thirty,
the tip of some swollen extremity burst in a silent explosion of charged particles, a distant fog of
ruptured, freezing atmosphere. Even as it faded I could make out wisps and streamers swirling into
complex spirals: Rorschach's magnetic field, sculpting the artefact's very breath into radioactive sleet.
I'd never seen it with naked eyes before. I felt like an insect on a starry midwinter's night, falling
through the aftermath of a forest fire.
The sled fired its brakes. I snapped back against the webbing of my harness, bumped against the
rebounding armored body next to me. Sascha. Only Sascha, I remembered. Cunningham had sedated
the rest of them, left this one core lonely and alone in the ^Page-213

[[Chapter-14#^Page-214]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-214
group body. I hadn't even realized that that
was possible with multiple personalities. She stared back at me from behind her faceplate. None of her
surfaces showed through the suit. I could see nothing in her eyes.
That was happening so often, these days.
Cunningham was not with us. Nobody had asked why, when Sarasti assigned the berths. The biologist
was first among equals now, a backup restored with no other behind him. The second-least replaceable
of our irreplaceable crew.
It made me a better bargain. The odds I bought had increased to one in three.
A silent bump shuddered up the frame. I looked forward again, past Bates on the front pallet, past the
anchored drones that flanked her two to each side. The sled had launched its assault, a prefab
inflatable vestibule mounted on an explosive injection assembly that would punch through
Rorschach's skin like a virus penetrating a host cell. The spindle-legged contraption dwindled and
disappeared from my sight. Moments later a pinpoint sodium sun flared and died against the ebony
landscape ahead—antimatter charge, so small you could almost count the atoms, shot directly into the
hull. A lot rougher than the tentative foreplay of our first date.
We landed, hard, while the vestibule was still inflating. The grunts were off the sled an instant before
contact, spitting tiny puffs of gas from their nozzles, arranging themselves around us in a protective
rosette. Bates was up next, leaping free of her restraints and sailing directly towards the swelling hab.
Sascha and I unloaded the fiberop hub—a clamshell drum half a meter thick and three times as wide—
lugging it between us while one of the grunts slipped through the vestibule's membranous airlock.
"Let's move, people." Bates was hanging off one of the inflatable's handholds. "Thirty minutes to—"
She fell silent. I didn't have to ask why: the advance grunt had ^Page-214

[[Chapter-14#^Page-215]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-215
positioned itself over the newly-blasted
entrance and sent back its first postcard.
Light from below.
*
You'd think that would have made it easier. Our kind has always feared the dark; for millions of years
we huddled in caves and burrows while unseen things snuffled and growled—or just waited, silent and
undetectable—in the night beyond. You'd think that any light, no matter how meager, might strip
away some of the shadows, leave fewer holes for the mind to fill with worst imaginings.
You'd think.
We followed the grunt down into a dim soupy glow like blood-curdled milk. At first it seemed as
though the atmosphere itself was alight, a luminous fog that obscured anything more than ten meters
distant. An illusion, as it turned out; the tunnel we emerged into was about three meters wide and lit
by rows of raised glowing dashes—the size and approximate shape of dismembered human fingers—
wound in a loose triple helix around the walls. We'd recorded similar ridges at the first site, although
the breaks had not been so pronounced and the ridges had been anything but luminous.
"Stronger in the near-infrared," Bates reported, flashing the spectrum to our HUDs. The air would
have been transparent to pit vipers. It was transparent to sonar: the lead grunt sprayed the fog with
click trains and discovered that the tunnel widened into some kind of chamber seventeen meters
further along. Squinting in that direction I could just make out subterranean outlines through the mist.
I could just make out jawed things, pulling back out of sight.
"Let's go," Bates said.
We plugged in the grunts, left one guarding the way out. Each of us took another as a guardian angel
on point. The machines spoke to our HUDs via laser link; they spoke to each other along stiffened ^Page-215

[[Chapter-14#^Page-216]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-216
lengths of shielded fiberop that unspooled from the hub trailing in our wake. It was the best available
compromise in an environment without any optima. Our tethered bodyguards would keep us all in
touch during lone excursions around corners or down dead ends.
Yeah. Lone excursions. Forced to either split the group or cover less ground, we were to split the
group. We were speed-cartographers panning for gold. Everything we did here was an act of faith:
faith that the unifying principals of Rorschach's internal architecture could be derived from the raw
dimensions we'd grab on the run. Faith that Rorschach's internal architecture even had unifying
principles. Earlier generations had worshipped malign and capricious spirits. Ours put its faith in an
ordered universe. Here in the Devil's Baklava, it was easy to wonder if our ancestors hadn't been closer
to the mark.
We moved along the tunnel. Our destination resolved to merely human eyes: not so much chamber as
nexus, a knot of space formed by the convergence of a dozen tunnels angling in from different
orientations. Ragged meshes of quicksilver dots gleamed along several glistening surfaces; shiny
protrusions poked through the substrate like a scattershot blast of ball-bearings pressed into wet clay.
I looked at Bates and Sascha. "Control panel?"
Bates shrugged. Her drones panned the throats around us, spraying sonar down each. My HUD
sketched a patchy three-d model from the echoes: swathes of paint thrown against invisible walls. We
were dots near the center of a ganglion, a tiny swarm of parasites infesting some great hollowed host.
Each tunnel curved away in a gradual spiral, each along a different orientation. Sonar could peep
around those bends a few meters further than we could. Neither eyes nor ultrasonics saw anything to
distinguish one choice from another.
Bates pointed down one of the passageways—"Keeton—" and another— "Sascha," before turning to
coast off down her own unbeaten path. ^Page-216

[[Chapter-14#^Page-217]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-217
I looked uneasily down mine. "Any particular—"
"Twenty-five minutes," she said.
I turned and jetted slowly down my assigned passageway. The passage curved clockwise, a long
unremarkable spiral; after twenty meters that curvature would have blocked any view of its entrance
even if the foggy atmosphere hadn't. My drone kept point across the tunnel, its sonar clicking like the
chattering of a thousand tiny teeth, its tether unspooling back to the distant drum in the nexus.
It was a comfort, that leash. It was short. The grunts could stray ninety meters and no further, and we
were under strict orders to stay under their wings at all times. This dim infested burrow might lead all
the way to hell, but I would not be expected to follow it nearly so far. My cowardice had official
sanction.
Fifty meters to go. Fifty meters and I could turn and run with my tail between my legs. In the
meantime all I had to do was grit my teeth, and focus, and record: everything you see, Sarasti had said.
As much as possible of what you can't. And hope that this new reduced time limit would expire before
Rorschach spiked us into gibbering dementia.
The walls around me twitched and shivered like the flesh of something just-killed. Something darted
in and out of sight with a faint cackle of laughter.
Focus. Record. If the grunt doesn't see it, it's not real.
Sixty-five meters in, one of the ghosts got inside my helmet.
I tried to ignore it. I tried to look away. But this phantom wasn't flickering at the edge of vision; it
hovered near the center of my faceplate, floating like a spot of swirling dizziness between me and the
HUD. I gritted my teeth and tried to look past, stared into the dim bloody haze of the middle distance,
watched the jerky unfolding travelogues in the little windows labeled Bates and James. Nothing out
there. But in here, floating before my eyes, Rorschach's latest headfuck smeared a fuzzy thumbprint
right in front of the sonar feed. ^Page-217

[[Chapter-14#^Page-218]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-218
"New symptom," I called in. "Nonperipheral hallucination, stable, pretty formless though. No spiking
that I can—"
The inset marked Bates skidded hard about. "Keet—"
Window and voice cut out together.
Not just Bates' window, either. Sascha's inset and the drone's-eye sonarscape flickered and died at the
same moment, stripped my HUD bare except for in-suit feeds and a little red readout flashing Link
Down. I spun but the grunt was still there, three meters off my right shoulder. Its optical port was
clearly visible, a ruby thumbnail set into the plastron.
Its gun ports were visible too. Pointing at me.
I froze. The drone shivered in some local electromagnetic knot as if terrified. Of me, or—
Of something behind me...
I started to turn. My helmet filled with sudden static, and with what sounded—faintly—like a voice:
"—ucking move, Kee—not—"
"Bates? Bates?" Another icon had bloomed in place of Link Down. The grunt was using radio for
some reason—and though almost close enough to touch, I could barely make out the signal.
A hash of Batespeak: "—to your—right in front of—" and Sascha as well, a bit more clearly: "—an't
he see it?..."
"See what? Sascha! Someone tell me what—see what?"
"—read? Keeton, do you read?"
Somehow Bates had boosted the signal; static roared like an ocean, but I could hear the words behind
it. "Yes! What—"
"Keep absolutely still, do you understand? Absolutely still. Acknowledge."
"Acknowledged." The drone kept me in its shaky sights, dark stereocam irises spasming wide,
stuttering to pinpoints. "Wha—"
"There's something in front of you, Keeton. Directly between you and the grunt. Can't you see it?" ^Page-218

[[Chapter-14#^Page-219]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-219
"N-no. My HUD's down—"
Sascha broke in: "How can he not see it it's right th—"
Bates barked over her: "It's man-sized, radially symmetrical, eight, nine arms. Like tentacles, but—
segmented. Spiky."
"I don't see anything," I said. But I did: I saw something reaching for me, in my pod back aboard
Theseus. I saw something curled up motionless in the ship's spine, watching as we laid our best plans.
I saw Michelle the synesthesiac, curled into a fetal ball: You can't see it...it's in—visible...
"What's it doing?" I called. Why can't I see it? Why can't I see it?
"Just—floating there. Kind of waving. Oh, sh—Keet—"
The grunt skidded sideways, as if slapped by a giant hand. It bounced off the wall and suddenly the
laser link was back, filling the HUD with intelligence: first-person perspectives of Bates and Sascha
racing along alien tunnels, a grunt's-eye view of a space suit with Keeton stenciled across its
breastplate and there, right beside it, some thing like a rippling starfish with too many arms—
The Gang barreled around the curve and now I almost could see something with my own eyes,
flickering like heat-lightning off to one side. It was large, and it was moving, but somehow my eyes
just slid off every time they tried to get a fix. It's not real, I thought, giddy with hysterical relief, it's
just another hallucination but then Bates sailed into view and it was right there, no flickering, no
uncertainty, nothing but a collapsed probability wave and solid, undeniable mass. Exposed, it grabbed
the nearest wall and scrambled over our heads, segmented arms flailing like whips. A sudden
crackling buzz in the back of my head and it was drifting free again, charred and smoking.
A stuttering click. The whine of machinery gearing down. Three grunts hovered in formation in the
middle of the passageway. One faced the alien. I glimpsed the tip of some lethal proboscis sliding ^Page-219

[[Chapter-14#^Page-220]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-220
back into its sheath. Bates shut the grunt down before it had finished closing its mouth.
Optical links and three sets of lungs filled my helmet with a roar of heavy breathing.
The offlined grunt drifted in the murky air. The alien carcass bumped gently off the wall, twitching: a
hydra of human backbones, scorched and fleshless. It didn't look much like my on-board visions after
all.
For some reason I couldn't put my finger on, I found that almost reassuring.
The two active grunts panned the fog until Bates gave them new orders; then one turned to secure the
carcass, the other to steady its fallen comrade. Bates grabbed the dead grunt and unplugged its tether.
"Fall back. Slowly. I'm right behind you."
I tweaked my jets. Sascha hesitated. Coils of shielded cable floated about us like umbilical cords.
"Now," Bates said, plugging a feed from her own suit directly into the offlined grunt.
Sascha started after me. Bates took up the rear. I watched my HUD; a swarm of multiarmed monsters
would appear there any moment.
They didn't. But the blackened thing against the belly of Bates' machine was real enough. Not a
hallucination. Not even some understandable artefact of fear and synesthesia. Rorschach was
inhabited. Its inhabitants were invisible.
Sometimes. Sort of.
And, oh yeah. We'd just killed one.
*
Bates threw the deactivated grunt into the sky as soon as we'd made vacuum. Its comrades used it for
target practice while we strapped in, firing and firing until there was nothing left but cooling vapor. ^Page-220

[[Chapter-14#^Page-221]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-221
Rorschach spun even that faint plasma into filigree before it faded.
Halfway back to Theseus, Sascha turned to the Major: "You—"
"No."
"But— they do shit on their own, right? Autonomous."
"Not when they're slaved."
"Malfunction? Spike?"
Bates didn't answer.
She called ahead. By the time we made it back Cunningham had grown another little tumor on
Theseus' spine, a remote surgery packed with teleops and sensors. One of the surviving grunts grabbed
the carcass and jumped ship as soon as we passed beneath the carapace, completing the delivery as we
docked.
We were born again to the fruits of a preliminary necropsy. The holographic ghost of the dissected
alien rose from ConSensus like some flayed and horrific feast. Its splayed arms looked like human
spinal columns. We sat around the table and waited for someone else to take the first bite.
"Did you have to shoot it with microwaves?" Cunningham sniped, tapping the table. "You completely
cooked the animal. Every cell was blown out from the inside."
Bates shook her head. "There was a malfunction."
He gave her a sour look. "A malfunction that just happens to involve precise targeting of a moving
object. It doesn't sound random to me."
Bates looked back evenly. "Something flipped autonomous targeting from off to on. A coin toss.
Random."
"Random is—"
"Give it a rest, Cunningham. I don't need this shit from you right now."
His eyes rolled in that smooth dead face, focused suddenly on something overhead. I followed his
gaze: Sarasti stared down at us ^Page-221

[[Chapter-14#^Page-222]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-222
like an owl panning for meadow voles, drifting slowly in the Coriolis
breeze.
No visor this time, either. I knew he hadn't lost it.
He fixed Cunningham. "Your findings."
Cunningham swallowed. Bits and pieces of alien anatomy flickered with color-coded highlights as he
tapped his fingers. "Right, then. I'm afraid I can't give you much at the cellular level. There's not much
left inside the membranes. Not many membranes left, for that matter. In terms of gross morphology,
the specimen's dorsoventrally compressed and radially symmetrical, as you can see. Calcareous
exoskeleton, keratinised plastic cuticle. Nothing special."
Bates looked skeptical. "Plastic skin is 'nothing special'?"
"Given the environment I was half-expecting a Sanduloviciu plasma. Plastic's simply refined
petroleum. Organocarbon. This thing is carbon-based. It's even protein based, although its proteins are
a great deal tougher than ours. Numerous sulphur cross-bonds for lateral bracing, as far as I could tell
from what your grunts didn't denature." Cunningham's eyes looked past us all; his consciousness was
obviously far aft, haunting remote sensors. "The thing's tissues are saturated with magnetite. On earth
you find that material in dolphin brains, migratory birds, even some bacteria—anything that navigates
or orients using magnetic fields. Moving up to macrostructures we've got a pneumatic internal
skeleton, which as far as I can tell doubles as musculature. Contractile tissue squeezes gas through a
system of bladders that stiffen or relax each segment in the arms."
The light came back into Cunningham's eyes long enough to focus on his cigarette. He brought it to
his mouth, dragged deeply, set it down again. "Note the invaginations around the base of each arm."
Flaccid balloons glowed orange on the virtual carcass. "Cloacae, you could call them. Everything
opens into them: they eat, breathe, and defecate through the same little compartment. No other major
orifices." ^Page-222

[[Chapter-14#^Page-223]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-223
The Gang made a face that said Sascha, grossed out. "Don't things get—clogged up? Seems
inefficient."
"If one gets plugged, there's eight other doors into the same system. You'll wish you were so
inefficient the next time you choke on a chicken bone."
"What does it eat?" Bates asked.
"I couldn't say. I found gizzard-like contractiles around the cloacae, which implies they chew on
something, or did at some point in their history. Other than that..." He spread his hands; the cigarette
left faint streamers in its wake. "Inflate those contractiles enough and you create an airtight seal, by
the way. In conjunction with the cuticle, that would allow this organism to survive briefly in vacuum.
And we already know it can handle the ambient radiation, although don't ask me how. Whatever it
uses for genes must be a great deal tougher than ours."
"So it can survive in space," Bates mused.
"In the sense that a dolphin survives underwater. Limited time only."
"How long?"
"I'm not certain."
"Central nervous system," Sarasti said.
Bates and the Gang grew suddenly, subtly still. James's affect seeped out over her body, supplanting
Sascha's.
Smoke curled from Cunningham's mouth and nose. "There's nothing central about it, as it transpires.
No cephalisation, not even clustered sense organs. The body's covered with something like eyespots,
or chromatophores, or both. There are setae everywhere. And as far as I can tell—if all those little
cooked filaments I've been able to put back together after your malfunction really are nerves and not
something completely different—every one of those structures is under independent control."
Bates sat up straight. "Seriously?"
He nodded. "It would be akin to independently controlling the ^Page-223

[[Chapter-14#^Page-224]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-224
movement of each individual hair on
your head, although this creature is covered with little hairs from tip to tip. The same thing applies to
the eyes. Hundreds of thousands of eyes, all over the cuticle. Each one is barely more than a pinhole
camera, but each is capable of independent focus and I'm guessing all the different inputs integrate
somewhere up the line. The entire body acts like a single diffuse retina. In theory that gives it
enormous visual acuity."
"A distributed telescope array," Bates murmured.
"A chromatophore underlies each eye—the pigment's some kind of cryptochrome so it's probably
involved in vision, but it can also diffuse or contract through the local tissue. That implies dynamic
pigment patterns, like a squid or a chameleon."
"Background pattern-matching?" Bates asked. "Would that explain why Siri couldn't see it?"
Cunningham opened a new window and played grainy looped imagery of Siri Keeton and his unseen
dance partner. The creature I hadn't noticed was ominously solid to the cameras: a floating discoid
twice as wide as my own torso, arms extending from its edges like thick knotted ropes. Patterns
rippled across its surface in waves; sunlight and shadow playing on a shallow seabed.
"As you can see, the background doesn't match the pattern," Cunningham said. "It's not even close."
"Can you explain Siri's blindness to it?" Sarasti said.
"I can't," Cunningham admitted. "It's beyond ordinary crypsis. But Rorschach makes you see all sorts
of things that aren't there. Not seeing something that is there might come down to essentially the same
thing."
"Another hallucination?" I asked.
Another shrug while Cunningham sucked smoke. "There are many ways to fool the human visual
system. It's interesting that the illusion failed when multiple witnesses were present, but if you want a
definitive mechanism you'll have to give me more to work ^Page-224

[[Chapter-14#^Page-225]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-225
with than that." He stabbed his cigarette
hand at the crisped remains.
"But—" James took a breath, bracing herself— "We're talking about something... sophisticated, at
least. Something very complex. A great deal of processing power."
Cunningham nodded again. "I'd estimate nervous tissue accounts for about thirty percent of body
mass."
"So it's intelligent." Her voice was almost a whisper.
"Not remotely."
"But—thirty percent—"
"Thirty percent motor and sensory wiring." Another drag. "Much like an octopus; an enormous
number of neurons, but half of them get used up running the suckers."
"My understanding is that octopi are quite intelligent," James said.
"By molluscan standards, certainly. But do you have any idea how much extra cabling you'd need if
the photoreceptors in your eye were spread across your entire body? You'd need about three hundred
million extension cords to begin with, ranging from half a millimeter to two meters long. Which
means all your signals are staggered and out of synch, which means billions of additional logic gates
to cohere the input. And that just gets you a single static image, with no filtering, no interpretation, no
time-series integration at all." Shiver. Drag. "Now multiply that by all the extra wiring needed to focus
all those eyespots on an object, or to send all that information back to individual chromatophores, and
then add in the processing power you need to drive those chromatophores one at a time. Thirty percent
might do all that, but I strongly doubt you'd have much left over for philosophy and science." He
waved his hand in the general direction of the hold. "That—that—"
"Scrambler," James suggested.
Cunningham rolled his tongue around it. "Very well. That ^Page-225

[[Chapter-14#^Page-226]] ~Chapter-14 ~Page-226
scrambler is an absolute miracle of
evolutionary engineering. It's also dumb as a stick."
A moment's silence.
"So what is it?" James asked at last. "Somebody's pet?"
"Canary in a coal mine," Bates suggested.
"Perhaps not even that," Cunningham said. "Perhaps no more than a white blood cell with waldoes.
Maintenance bot, maybe. Teleoperated, or instinct-driven. But people, we're ignoring far greater
questions here. How could an anaerobe even develop complex multicellular anatomy, much less move
as fast as this thing did? That level of activity burns a great deal of ATP."
"Maybe they don't use ATP," Bates said as I thumbnailed: adenosine triphosphate. Cellular energy
source.
"It was crammed with ATP," Cunningham told her. "You can tell that much even with these remains.
The question is, how can it synthesize the stuff fast enough to keep up with demand. Purely anaerobic
pathways wouldn't suffice."
Nobody offered any suggestions.
"Anyway," he said, "So endeth the lesson. If you want gory details, check ConSensus." He wiggled the
fingers of his free hand: the spectral dissection vanished. "I'll keep working, but if you want any real
answers go get me a live one." He butted out his cigarette against the bulkhead and stared defiantly
around the drum.
The others hardly reacted; their topologies still sparkled from the revelations of a few minutes before.
Perhaps Cunningam's pet peeve was more important to the Big Picture; perhaps, in a reductionist
universe, biochemical basics should always take priority over the finer points of ETI and interspecies
etiquette. But Bates and the Gang were time-lagged, processing earlier revelations. Not just
processing, either: wallowing. They clung to Cunningham's findings like convicted felons who'd just
discovered they might be freed on a technicality.

it. But it wasn't an alien, not really. It
wasn't intelligent. It was just a blood cell with waldoes. It was dumb as a stick. 
And property damage is so much easier to live with than murder. ^Page-227
