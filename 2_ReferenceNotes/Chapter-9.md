"Mothers are fonder than fathers of their children because they are more certain they are their own."
—Aristotle
I couldn't say goodbye to Dad. I didn't even know where he was.
I didn't want to say goodbye to Helen. I didn't want to go back there. That was the problem: I didn't
have to. There was nowhere left in the world where the mountain couldn't simply pick up and move to
Mohammed. Heaven was merely a suburb of the global village, and the global village left me no
excuse.
I linked from my own apartment. My new inlays—mission-specific, slid into my head just the week
before—shook hands with the noosphere and knocked upon the Pearly Gates. Some tame spirit, more
plausible than Saint Peter if no less ethereal, took a message and disappeared.
And I was inside.
This was no antechamber, no visiting room. Heaven was not intended for the casual visitor; any
paradise in which the flesh-constrained would feel at home would have been intolerably pedestrian to
the disembodied souls who lived there. Of course, there was no reason why visitor and resident had to
share the same view. I could have pulled any conventional worldview off the shelf if I'd wanted, seen
this place rendered in any style I chose. Except for the Ascended themselves, of course. That was one
of the perks of the Afterlife: only they got to choose the face we saw.
But the thing my mother had become had no face, and I was damned if she was going to see me hide
behind some mask.
"Hello, Helen."
"Siri! What a wonderful surprise!"
She was an abstraction in an abstraction: an impossible intersection of dozens of bright panes, as if the
disassembled tiles of a stained-glass window had each been set aglow and animated. She swirled
before me like a school of fish. Her world echoed her body: lights and angles and three-dimensional
Escher impossibilities, piled like bright thunderheads. And yet, somehow I would have recognised her
anywhere. Heaven was a dream; only upon waking do you realize that the characters you encountered
looked nothing like they do in real life.
There was only one familiar landmark anywhere in the whole sensorium. My mother's heaven smelled
of cinnamon.
I beheld her luminous avatar and imagined the corpus soaking in a tank of nutrients, deep
underground. "How are you doing?"
"Very well. Very well. Of course, it takes a little getting used to, knowing your mind isn't quite yours
any more." Heaven didn't just feed the brains of its residents; it fed off them, used the surplus power of
idle synapses to run its own infrastructure. "You have to move in here, sooner better than later. You'll
never leave."
"Actually, I am leaving," I said. "We're shipping out tomorrow."
"Shipping out?"
"The Kuiper. You know. The Fireflies?"
"Oh yes. I think I heard something about that. We don't get much news from the outside world, you
know."
"Anyway, just thought I'd call in and say goodbye."
"I'm glad you did. I've been hoping to see you without, you know."
"Without what?"
"You know. Without your father listening in."
Not again.
"Dad's in the field, Helen. Interplanetary crisis. You might have heard something."
"I certainly have. You know, I haven't always been happy about your father's—extended assignments,
but maybe it was really a blessing in disguise. The less he was around, the less he could do."
"Do?"
"To you." The apparition stilled for a few moments, feigning hesitation. "I've never told you this
before, but—no. I shouldn't."
"Shouldn't what?"
"Bring up, well, old hurts."
"What old hurts?" Right on cue. I couldn't help myself, the training went too deep. I always barked on
command.
"Well," she began, "sometimes you'd come back—you were so very young—and your face would be
so set and hard, and I'd wonder why are you so angry, little boy? What can someone so young have to
be so angry about?"
"Helen, what are you talking about? Back from where?"
"Just from the places he'd take you." Something like a shiver passed across her facets. "He was still
around back then. He wasn't so important, he was just an accountant with a karate fetish, going on
about forensics and game theory and astronomy until he put everyone to sleep."
I tried to imagine it: my father, the chatterbox. "That doesn't sound like Dad."
"Well of course not. You were too young to remember, but he was just a little man, then. He still is,
really, under all the secret missions and classified briefings. I've never understood why people never
saw that. But even back then he liked to—well, it wasn't his fault, I suppose. He had a very difficult
childhood, and he never learned to deal with problems like an adult. He, well, he'd throw his weight
around, I guess you'd say. Of course I didn't know that before we married. If I had, I—but I made a
commitment. I made a commitment, and I never broke it."
"What, are you saying you were abused?" Back from the places he'd take you. "Are—are you saying I
was?"
"There are all kinds of abuse, Siri. Words can hurt more than bullets, sometimes. And child
abandonment—"
"He didn't abandon me." He left me with you.
"He abandoned us, Siri. Sometimes for months at a time, and I—and we never knew if he was coming
back And he chose to do that to us, Siri. He didn't need that job, there were so many other things he
was qualified to do. Things that had been redundant for years."
I shook my head, incredulous, unable to say it aloud: she hated him because he hadn't had the good
grace to grow unnecessary?
"It's not Dad's fault that planetary security is still an essential service," I said.
She continued as if she hadn't heard. "Now there was a time when it was unavoidable, when people our
age had to work just to make ends meet. But even back then people wanted to spend time with their
families. Even if they couldn't afford to. To, to choose to stay working when it isn't even necessary,
that's—" She shattered and reassembled at my shoulder. "Yes, Siri. I believe that's a kind of abuse.
And if your father had been half as loyal to me as I've been to him all these years..."
I remembered Jim, the last time I'd seen him: snorting vassopressin under the restless eyes of robot
sentries. "I don't think Dad's been disloyal to either of us."
Helen sighed. "I don't really expect you to understand. I'm not completely stupid, I've seen how it
played out. I pretty much had to raise you myself all these years. I always had to play the heavy,
always had to be the one to hand out the discipline because your father was off on some secret
assignment. And then he'd come home for a week or two and he was the golden-haired boy just
because he'd seen fit to drop in. I don't really blame you for that any more than I blame him. Blame
doesn't solve anything at this stage. I just thought—well, really, I thought you ought to know. Take it
for what it's worth."
A memory, unbidden: called into Helen's bed when I was nine, her hand stroking my scar, her stale
sweet breath stirring against my cheek. You're the man of the house now Siri. We can't count on your
father any more. It's just you and me...
I didn't say anything for a while. Finally: "Didn't it help at all?"
"What do you mean?"
I glanced around at all that customized abstraction: internal feedback, lucidly dreamed. "You're
omnipotent in here. Desire anything, imagine anything; there it is. I'd thought it would have changed
you more."
Rainbow tiles danced, and forced a laugh. "This isn't enough of a change for you?"
Not nearly.
Because Heaven had a catch. No matter how many constructs and avatars Helen built in there, no
matter how many empty vessels sang her praises or commiserated over the injustices she'd suffered,
when it came right down to it she was only talking to herself. There were other realities over which
she had no control, other people who didn't play by her rules—and if they thought of Helen at all, they
thought as they damn well pleased.
She could go the rest of her life without ever meeting any of them. But she knew they were out there,
and it drove her crazy. Taking my leave of Heaven, it occurred to me that omnipotent though she was,
there was only be one way my mother would ever be truly happy in her own personal creation.
The rest of creation would have to go.

"This shouldn't keep happening," Bates said. "The shielding was good."
The Gang was up across the drum, squaring away something in their tent. Sarasti lurked offstage
today, monitoring the proceedings from his quarters. That left me with Bates and Szpindel in the
Commons.
"Maybe against direct EM." Szpindel stretched, stifled a yawn. "Ultrasound boots up magnetic fields
through shielding sometimes, in living tissue at least. Any chance something like that could be
happening with your electronics?"
Bates spread her hands. "Who knows? Might as well be black magic and elves down there."
"Well, it's not a total wash. We can make a few smart guesses, eh?"
"Such as."
Szpindel raised one finger. "The layers we cut through couldn't result from any metabolic process I
know about. So it's not 'alive', not in the biological sense. Not that that means anything these days," he
added, glancing around the belly of our beast.
"What about life inside the structure?"
"Anoxic atmosphere. Probably rules out complex multicellular life. Microbes, maybe, although if so I
wish to hell they show up in the samples. But anything complex enough to think, let alone build
something like that"—a wave at the image in ConSensus—"is gonna need a high-energy metabolism,
and that means oxygen."
"So you think it's empty?"
"Didn't say that, did I? I know aliens are supposed to be all mysterious and everything, but I still don't
see why anyone would build a city-sized wildlife refuge for anaerobic microbes."
"It's got to be a habitat for something. Why any atmosphere at all, if it's just some kind of terraforming
machine?"
Szpindel pointed up at the Gang's tent. "What Susan said. Atmosphere's still under construction and
we get a free ride until the owners show up."
"Free?"
"Freeish. And I know we've only seen a fraction of a fraction of what's inside. But something
obviously saw us coming. It yelled at us, as I recall. If they're smart and they're hostile, why aren't
they shooting?"
"Maybe they are."
"If something's hiding down the hall wrecking your robots, it's not frying them any faster than the
baseline environment would do anyway."
"What you call a baseline environment might be an active counterintrusion measure. Why else would
a habitat be so uninhabitable?"
Szpindel rolled his eyes. "Okay, I was wrong. We don't know enough to make a few smart guesses."
Not that we hadn't tried. Once Jack's sensor head had been irreparably fried, we'd relegated it to
surface excavation; it had widened the bore in infinitesimal increments, patiently burning back the
edges of our initial peephole until it measured almost a meter across. Meanwhile we'd customized
Bates's grunts—shielded them against nuclear reactors and the insides of cyclotrons—and come
perigee we'd thrown them at Rorschach like stones chucked into a haunted forest. Each had gone
through Jack's portal, unspooling whisker-thin fiberop behind them to pass intelligence through the
charged atmosphere.
They'd sent glimpses, mostly. A few extended vignettes. We'd seen Rorschach's walls move, slow lazy
waves of peristalsis rippling along its gut. We'd seen treacly invaginations in progress, painstaking
constrictions that would presumably, given time, seal off a passageway. Our grunts had sailed through
some quarters, staggered through others where the magnetic ambience threw them off balance. They'd
passed through strange throats lined with razor-thin teeth, thousands of triangular blades in parallel
rows, helically twisted. They'd edged cautiously around clouds of mist sculpted into abstract fractal
shapes, shifting and endlessly recursive, their charged droplets strung along a myriad converging lines
of electromagnetic force.
Ultimately, every one of them had died or disappeared.
"Any way to increase the shielding?" I wondered.
Szpindel gave me a look.
"We've shielded everything except the sensor heads," Bates explained. "If we shield those we're
blind."
"But visible light's harmless enough. What about purely optical li—"
"We're using optical links, commissar," Szpindel snapped. "And you may have noticed the shit's
getting through anyway."
"But aren't there, you know—" I groped for the word— "bandpass filters? Something that lets visible
wavelengths through, cuts out the lethal stuff on both sides?"
He snorted. "Sure. It's called an atmosphere, and if we'd brought one with us—about fifty times deeper
than Earth's— it might block some of that soup down there. Course, Earth also gets a lot of help from
its magnetic field, but I'm not betting my life on any EM we set up in that place."
"If we didn't keep running into these spikes," Bates said. "That's the real problem."
"Are they random?" I wondered.
Szpindel's shrug was half shiver. "I don't think anything about that place is random. But who knows?
We need more data."
"Which we're not likely to get," James said, walking around the ceiling to join us, "if our drones keep
shorting out."
The conditional was pure formality. We'd tried playing the odds, sacrificing drone after drone in the
hope that one of them would get lucky; survival rates tailed exponentially to zero with distance from
base camp. We'd tried shielding the fiberop to reduce aperture leakage; the resulting tethers were stiff
and unwieldy, wrapped in so many layers of ferroceramic that we were virtually waving the bots
around on the end of a stick. We'd tried cutting the tethers entirely, sending the machines out to
explore on their own, squinting against the radiant blizzard and storing their findings for later
download; none had returned. We'd tried everything.
"We can go in ourselves," James said.
Almost everything.
"Right," Szpindel replied in a voice that couldn't mean anything but wrong.
"It's the only way to learn anything useful."
"Yeah. Like how many seconds it would take your brain to turn into synchrotron soup."
"Our suits can be shielded."
"Oh, you mean like Mandy's drones?"
"I'd really rather you didn't call me that," Bates remarked.
"The point is, Rorschach kills you whether you're meat or mechanical."
"My point is that it kills meat differently," James replied. "It takes longer."
Szpindel shook his head. "You'd be good as dead in fifty minutes. Even shielded. Even in the so-called
cool zones."
"And completely asymptomatic for three hours or more. And even after that it would take days for us
to actually die and we'd be back here long before then, and the ship could patch us up just like that. We
even know that much, Isaac, it's right there in ConSensus. And if we know it, you know it. So we
shouldn't even be having this argument."
"That's your solution? We saturate ourselves with radiation every thirty hours and then I get to cut out
the tumors and stitch everyone's cells back together?"
"The pods are automatic. You wouldn't have to lift a finger."
"Not to mention the number those magnetic fields would do on your brain. We'd be hallucinating from
the moment we—"
"Faraday the suits."
"Ah, so we go in deaf dumb and blind. Good idea."
"We can let light pass. Infrared—"
"It's all EM, Suze. Even if we blacked out our helmets completely and used a camera feed, we'd get
leakage where the wire went through."
"Some, yes. But it'd be better than—"
"Jesus." A tremor sent spittle sailing from the corner of Szpindel's mouth. "Let me talk to Mi—"
"I've discussed it with the rest of the gang, Isaac. We're all agreed."
"All agreed? You don't have a working majority in there, Suze. Just because you cut your brain into
pieces doesn't mean they each get a vote."
"I don't see why not. We're each at least as sentient as you are."
"They're all you. Just partitioned."
"You don't seem to have any trouble treating Michelle as a separate individual."
"Michelle's—I mean, yes, you're all very different facets, but there's only one original. Your alters—"
"Don't call us that." Sascha erupted with a voice cold as LOX. "Ever."
Szpindel tried to pull back. "I didn't mean—you know I didn't—"
But Sascha was gone. "What are you saying?" said the softer voice in her wake. "Do you think I'm just,
I'm just Mom, play-acting? You think when we're together you're alone with her?"
"Michelle," Szpindel said miserably. "No. What I think—"
"Doesn't matter," Sarasti said. "We don't vote here."
He floated above us, visored and unreadable in the center of the drum. None of us had seen him arrive.
He turned slowly on his axis, keeping us in view as we rotated around him.
"Prepping Scylla. Amanda needs two untethered grunts with precautionary armament. Cams from one
to a million Angstroms, shielded tympanics, no autonomous circuitry. Platelet boosters,
dimenhydrinate and potassium iodide for everyone by 1350."
"Everyone?" Bates asked.
Sarasti nodded. "Window opens four hours twenty-three." He turned back down the spine
"Not me," I said.
Sarasti paused.
"I don't participate in field ops," I reminded him.
"Now you do."
"I'm a synthesist." He knew that. Of course he knew, everyone did: you can't observe the system unless
you stay outside the system.
"On Earth you're a synthesist," he said. "In the Kuiper you're a synthesist. Here you're mass. Do what
you're told."
He disappeared.
"Welcome to the big picture," Bates said softly.
I looked at her as the rest of the group broke up. "You know I—"
"We're a long way out, Siri. Can't wait fourteen months for feedback from your bosses, and you know
it."
She leapt from a standing start, arced smoothly through holograms into the weightless core of the
drum. But then she stopped herself, as if distracted by some sudden insight. She grabbed a spinal
conduit and swung back to face me.
"You shouldn't sell yourself short," she said. "Or Sarasti either. You're an observer, right? It's a safe
bet there's going to be a lot down there worth observing."
"Thanks," I said. But I already knew why Sarasti was sending me into Rorschach, and there was more
to it than observation.
Three valuable agents in harm's way. A decoy bought one-in-four odds that an enemy would aim
somewhere else.
