" Leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed sense of fear
and no concept of the odds against them."
—Robert Jarvik
Our scout fell towards orbit, watching Ben. We fell days behind, watching the scout. And that was all
we did: sit in Theseus' belly while the system streamed telemetry to our inlays. Essential,
irreplaceable, mission-critical—we might as well have been ballast during that first approach.
We passed Ben's Rayleigh limit. Theseus squinted at a meager emission spectrum and saw a rogue
halo element from Canis Major—a dismembered remnant of some long-lost galaxy that had drifted
into ours and ended up as road kill, uncounted billions of years ago. We were closing on something
from outside the Milky Way.
The probe arced down and in, drew close enough for false-color enhance. Ben's surface brightened to a
seething parfait of high-contrast bands against a diamond-hard starscape. Something twinkled there,
faint sparkles on endless overcast.
"Lightning?" James wondered.
Szpindel shook his head. "Meteorites. Must be a lot of rock in the neighborhood."
"Wrong color," Sarasti said. He was not physically among us—he was back in his tent, hardlined into
the Captain—but ConSensus put him anywhere on board he wanted to be.
Morphometrics scrolled across my inlays: mass, diameter, mean ^Page-73

[[Chapter-5#^Page-74]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-74
density. Ben's day lasted seven hours
twelve minutes. Diffuse but massive accretion belt circling the equator, more torus than ring,
extending almost a half-million kilometers from the cloud-tops: the pulverized corpses of moons
perhaps, ground down to leftovers.
"Meteorites." Szpindel grinned. "Told ya."
He seemed to be right; increasing proximity smeared many of those pinpoint sparkles into bright
ephemeral hyphens, scratching the atmosphere. Closer to the poles, cloud bands flickered with dim,
intermittent flashes of electricity.
Weak radio emission peaks at 31 and 400m. Outer atmosphere heavy with methane and ammonia;
lithium, water, carbon monoxide in abundance. Ammonia hydrogen sulfide, alkali halide mixing
locally in those torn swirling clouds. Neutral alkalis in the upper layers. By now even Theseus could
pick those things out from a distance, but our scout was close enough to see filigree. It no longer saw a
disk. It gazed down at a dark convex wall in seething layers of red and brown, saw faint stains of
anthracene and pyrene.
One of a myriad meteorite contrails scorched Ben's face directly ahead; for a moment I thought I
could even see the tiny dark speck at its core, but sudden static scratched the feed. Bates cursed softly.
The image blurred, then steadied as the probe pitched its voice higher up the spectrum. Unable to
make itself heard above the longwave din, now it spoke down a laser.
And still it stuttered. Keeping it aligned across a million fluctuating kilometers should have posed no
problem at all; our respective trajectories were known parabolas, our relative positions infinitely
predictable at any time t. But the meteorite's contrail jumped and skittered on the feed, as if the beam
were being repeatedly, infinitesimally knocked out of alignment. Incandescent gas blurred its details;
I doubted that even a rock-steady image would have offered any sharp edges for a human eye to hold
on to. Still. There was something wrong about it somehow, something about the tiny black dot at the
core of that fading brightness. Something that some primitive part of my mind refused to accept as
natural— ^Page-74

[[Chapter-5#^Page-75]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-75
The image lurched again, and flashed to black, and didn't return.
"Probe's fried," Bates reported. "Spike there at the end. Like it hit a Parker Spiral, but with a really
tight wind."
I didn't need to call up subtitles. It was obvious in the set of her face, the sudden creases between her
eyebrows: she was talking about a magnetic field.
"It's—" she began, and stopped as a number popped up in ConSensus: 11.2 Tesla.
"Holy shit," Szpindel whispered. "Is that right?"
Sarasti clicked from the back of his throat and the back of the ship. A moment later he served up an
instant replay, those last few seconds of telemetry zoomed and smoothed and contrast-enhanced from
visible light down to deep infrared. There was that same dark shard cauled in flame, there was the
contrail burning in its wake. Now it dimmed as the object skipped off the denser atmosphere beneath
and regained altitude. Within moments the heat trace had faded entirely. The thing that had burned at
its center rose back into space, a fading ember. A great conic scoop at its front end gaped like a mouth.
Stubby fins disfigured an ovoid abdomen.
Ben lurched and went out all over again.
"Meteorites," Bates said dryly.
The thing had left me with no sense of scale. It could have been an insect or an asteroid. "How big?" I
whispered, a split-second before the answer appeared on my inlays:
Four hundred meters along the major axis.
Ben was safely distant in our sights once more, a dark dim disk centered in Theseus's forward
viewfinder. But I remembered the close-up: a twinkling orb of black-hearted fires; a face gashed and
pockmarked, endlessly wounded, endlessly healing.
There'd been thousands of the things.
Theseus shivered along her length. It was just a pulse of decelerating thrust; but for that one moment, I
imagined I knew how she felt. ^Page-75

[[Chapter-5#^Page-76]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-76
We headed in and hedged our bets.
Theseus weaned herself with a ninety-eight-second burn, edged us into some vast arc that might, with
a little effort, turn into an orbit—or into a quick discreet flyby if the neighborhood turned out to be a
little too rough. The Icarus stream fell invisibly to port, its unswerving energy lost to space-time. Our
city-sized, molecule-thick parasol wound down and packed itself away until the next time the ship got
thirsty. Antimatter stockpiles began dropping immediately; this time we were alive to watch it
happen. The dip was infinitesimal, but there was something disquieting about the sudden appearance
of that minus sign on the display.
We could have retained the apron strings, left a buoy behind in the telematter stream to bounce energy
down the well after us. Susan James wondered why we hadn't.
"Too risky," Sarasti said, without elaboration.
Szpindel leaned in James' direction. "Why give 'em something else to shoot at, eh?"
We sent more probes ahead, though, spat them out hard and fast and too fuel-constrained for anything
but flyby and self-destruct. They couldn't take their eyes off the machines swinging around Big Ben.
Theseus stared her own unblinking stare, more distant though more acute. But if those high divers
even knew we were out there, they ignored us completely. We tracked them across the closing
distance, watched them swoop and loop though a million parabolas at a million angles. We never saw
them collide—not with each other, not with the cauldron of rock tumbling around Ben's equator.
Every perigee dipped briefly into atmosphere; there they burned, and slowed, and accelerated back
into space, their anterior scoops glowing with residual heat.
Bates grabbed a ConSensus image, drew highlights and a conclusion around the front end: "Scramjet." ^Page-76

[[Chapter-5#^Page-77]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-77
We tracked nearly four hundred thousand in less than two days. That appeared to be most of them;
new sightings leveled off afterwards, the cumulative curve flattening towards some theoretical
asymptote. Most of the orbits were close and fast, but Sarasti projected a frequency distribution
extending almost back to Pluto. We might stay out here for years, and still catch the occasional new
shovelnose returning from its extended foray into the void.
"The faster ones are pulling over fifty gees on the hairpin turn," Szpindel pointed out. "Meat couldn't
handle that. I say they're unmanned."
"Meat's reinforceable," Sarasti said.
"If it's got that much scaffolding you might as well stop splitting hairs and call it a machine anyway."
Surface morphometrics were absolutely uniform. Four hundred thousand divers, every one identical. If
there was an alpha male calling the shots among the herd, it couldn't be distinguished on sight.
One night—as such things were measured on board— I followed a soft squeal of tortured electronics
up to the observation blister. Szpindel floated there, watching the skimmers. He'd closed the
clamshells, blocked off the stars and built a little analytical nest in their place. Graphs and windows
spilled across the inside of the dome as though the virtual space in Szpindel's head was insufficient to
contain them. Tactical graphics lit him from all sides, turned his body into a bright patchwork of
flickering tattoos.
The Illustrated Man. "Mind if I come in?" I asked.
He grunted: Yeah, but not enough to push it.
Inside the dome, the sound of heavy rainfall hissed and spat behind the screeching that had led me
here. "What is that?"
"Ben's magnetosphere." He didn't look back. "Nice, eh?"
Synthesists don't have opinions on the job; it keeps observer effects to a minimum. This time I
permitted myself a small breach. "The static's nice. I could do without the screeching."
"Are you kidding? That's the music of the spheres, commissar. It's beautiful. Like old jazz." ^Page-77

[[Chapter-5#^Page-78]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-78
"I never got the hang of that either."
He shrugged and squelched the upper register, left the rain pattering around us. His jiggling eyes fixed
on some arcane graphic. "Want a scoop for your notes?"
"Sure."
"There you go." Light reflected off his feedback glove, iridescing like the wing of a dragonfly as he
pointed: an absorption spectrum, a looped time-series. Bright peaks surged and subsided, surged and
subsided across a fifteen-second timeframe.
Subtitles only gave me wavelengths and Angstroms. "What is it?"
"Diver farts. Those bastards are dumping complex organics into the atmosphere."
"How complex?"
"Hard to tell, so far. Faint traces, and they dissipate like that. But sugars and aminos at least. Maybe
proteins. Maybe more."
"Maybe life? Microbes?" An alien terraforming project...
"Depends on how you define life, eh?" Szpindel said. "Not even Deinococcus would last long down
there. But it's a big atmosphere. They better not be in any hurry if they're reworking the whole thing
by direct inoculation."
If they were, the job would go a lot faster with self-replicating inoculates. "Sounds like life to me."
"Sounds like agricultural aerosols, is what it sounds like. Those fuckers are turning the whole damn
gas ball into a rice paddy bigger than Jupiter." He gave me a scary grin. "Something's got a beeeg
appetite, hmm? You gotta wonder if we aren't gonna be a teeny bit outnumbered."
Szpindel's findings were front and center at our next get-together.
The vampire summed it up for us, visual aids dancing on the table: "Von Neumann self-replicating r-
selector. Seed washes up and ^Page-78

[[Chapter-5#^Page-79]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-79
sprouts skimmers, skimmers harvest raw materials from the accretion
belt. Some perturbations in those orbits; belt's still unsettled."
"Haven't seen any of the herd giving birth," Szpindel remarked. "Any sign of a factory?"
Sarasti shook his head. "Discarded, maybe. Decompiled. Or the herd stops breeding at optimal N."
"These are only the bulldozers," Bates pointed out. "There'll be tenants."
"A lot of 'em, eh?" Szpindel added. "Outnumber us by orders of mag."
James: "But they might not show up for centuries."
Sarasti clicked. "Do these skimmers build Fireflies? Burns-Caulfield?"
It was a rhetorical question. Szpindel answered anyway: "Don't see how."
"Something else does, then. Something already local."
Nobody spoke for a moment. James' topology shifted and shuffled in the silence; when she opened her
mouth again, someone indefinably younger was on top.
"Their habitat isn't anything like ours, if they're building a home way out here. That's hopeful."
Michelle. The synesthete.
"Proteins." Sarasti's eyes were unreadable behind the visor. Comparable biochemistries. They might
eat us.
"Whoever these beings are, they don't even live in sunlight. No territorial overlap, no resource
overlap, no basis for conflict. There's no reason we shouldn't get along just fine."
"On the other hand," Szpindel said, "Technology implies belligerence."
Michelle snorted softly. "According to a coterie of theoretical historians who've never actually met an
alien, yes. Maybe now we get to prove them wrong." And in the next instant she was just gone, ^Page-79

[[Chapter-5#^Page-80]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-80
her
affect scattered like leaves in a dust-devil, and Susan James was back in her place saying:
"Why don't we just ask them?"
"Ask?" Bates said.
"There are four hundred thousand machines out there. How do we know they can't talk?"
"We'd have heard.," Szpindel said. "They're drones."
"Can't hurt to ping them, just to make sure."
"There's no reason they should talk even if they are smart. Language and intelligence aren't all that
strongly correlated even on Ear—"
James rolled her eyes. "Why not try, at least? It's what we're here for. It's what I'm here for. Just send a
bloody signal."
After a moment Bates picked up the ball. "Bad game theory, Suze."
"Game theory." She made it sound like a curse.
"Tit-for-tat's the best strategy. They pinged us, we pinged back. Ball's in their court now; we send
another signal, we may give away too much."
"I know the rules, Amanda. They say if the other party never takes the initiative again, we ignore each
other for the rest of the mission because game theory says you don't want to look needy."
"The rule only applies when you're going up against an unknown player, " the Major explained. "We'll
have more options the more we learn."
James sighed. "It's just—you all seem to be going into this assuming they'll be hostile. As if a simple
hailing signal is going to bring them down on us."
Bates shrugged. "It only makes sense to be cautious. I may be a jarhead but I'm not eager to piss off
anything that hops between stars and terraforms superJovians for a living. I don't have to remind
anyone here that Theseus is no warship." ^Page-80

[[Chapter-5#^Page-81]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-81
She'd said anyone; she'd meant Sarasti. And Sarasti, focused on his own horizon, didn't answer. Not
out loud, at least; but his surfaces spoke in a different tongue entirely.
Not yet, they said.
Bates was right, by the way. Theseus was officially tricked out for exploration, not combat. No doubt
our masters would have preferred to load her up with nukes and particle cannons as well as her
scientific payload, but not even a telemattered fuel stream can change the laws of inertia. A
weaponized prototype would have taken longer to build; a more massive one, laden with heavy
artillery, would take longer to accelerate. Time, our masters had decided, was of greater essence than
armament. In a pinch our fabrication facilities could build most anything we needed, given time. It
might take a while to build a particle-beam cannon from scratch, and we might have to scavenge a
local asteroid for the raw material, but we could do it. Assuming our enemies would be willing to
wait, in the interests of fair play.
But what were the odds that even our best weapons would prove effective against the intelligence that
had pulled off the Firefall? If the unknown was hostile, we were probably doomed no matter what we
did. The Unknown was technologically advanced—and there were some who claimed that that made
them hostile by definition. Technology Implies Belligerence, they said.
I suppose I should explain that, now that it's completely irrelevant. You've probably forgotten after all
this time.
Once there were three tribes. The Optimists, whose patron saints were Drake and Sagan, believed in a
universe crawling with gentle intelligence—spiritual brethren vaster and more enlightened than we, a
great galactic siblinghood into whose ranks we would someday ascend. Surely, said the Optimists,
space travel implies enlightenment, ^Page-81

[[Chapter-5#^Page-82]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-82
for it requires the control of great destructive energies. Any race
which can't rise above its own brutal instincts will wipe itself out long before it learns to bridge the
interstellar gulf.
Across from the Optimists sat the Pessimists, who genuflected before graven images of Saint Fermi
and a host of lesser lightweights. The Pessimists envisioned a lonely universe full of dead rocks and
prokaryotic slime. The odds are just too low, they insisted. Too many rogues, too much radiation, too
much eccentricity in too many orbits. It is a surpassing miracle that even one Earth exists; to hope for
many is to abandon reason and embrace religious mania. After all, the universe is fourteen billion
years old: if the galaxy were alive with intelligence, wouldn't it be here by now?
Equidistant to the other two tribes sat the Historians. They didn't have too many thoughts on the
probable prevalence of intelligent, spacefaring extraterrestrials— but if there are any, they said,
they're not just going to be smart. They're going to be mean.
It might seem almost too obvious a conclusion. What is Human history, if not an ongoing succession
of greater technologies grinding lesser ones beneath their boots? But the subject wasn't merely Human
history, or the unfair advantage that tools gave to any given side; the oppressed snatch up advanced
weaponry as readily as the oppressor, given half a chance. No, the real issue was how those tools got
there in the first place. The real issue was what tools are for.
To the Historians, tools existed for only one reason: to force the universe into unnatural shapes. They
treated nature as an enemy, they were by definition a rebellion against the way things were.
Technology is a stunted thing in benign environments, it never thrived in any culture gripped by belief
in natural harmony. Why invent fusion reactors if your climate is comfortable, if your food is
abundant? Why build fortresses if you have no enemies? Why force change upon a world which poses
no threat?
Human civilization had a lot of branches, not so long ago. ^Page-82

[[Chapter-5#^Page-83]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-83
Even into the twenty-first century, a few
isolated tribes had barely developed stone tools. Some settled down with agriculture. Others weren't
content until they had ended nature itself, still others until they'd built cities in space.
We all rested eventually, though. Each new technology trampled lesser ones, climbed to some
complacent asymptote, and stopped—until my own mother packed herself away like a larva in
honeycomb, softened by machinery, robbed of incentive by her own contentment.
But history never said that everyone had to stop where we did. It only suggested that those who had
stopped no longer struggled for existence. There could be other, more hellish worlds where the best
Human technology would crumble, where the environment was still the enemy, where the only
survivors were those who fought back with sharper tools and stronger empires. The threats contained
in those environments would not be simple ones. Harsh weather and natural disasters either kill you or
they don't, and once conquered—or adapted to— they lose their relevance. No, the only environmental
factors that continued to matter were those that fought back, that countered new strategies with newer
ones, that forced their enemies to scale ever-greater heights just to stay alive. Ultimately, the only
enemy that mattered was an intelligent one.
And if the best toys do end up in the hands of those who've never forgotten that life itself is an act of
war against intelligent opponents, what does that say about a race whose machines travel between the
stars?
The argument was straightforward enough. It might even have been enough to carry the Historians to
victory—if such debates were ever settled on the basic of logic, and if a bored population hadn't
already awarded the game to Fermi on points. But the Historian paradigm was just too ugly, too
Darwinian, for most people, and besides, no one really cared any more. Not even the Cassidy Survey's
late-breaking discoveries changed much. So what if some dirtball at ^Page-83

[[Chapter-5#^Page-84]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-84
Ursae Majoris Eridani had an
oxygen atmosphere? It was forty-three lightyears away, and it wasn't talking; and if you wanted flying
chandeliers and alien messiahs, you could build them to order in Heaven. If you wanted testosterone
and target practice you could choose an afterlife chock-full of nasty alien monsters with really bad
aim. If the mere thought of an alien intelligence threatened your worldview, you could explore a
virtual galaxy of empty real estate, ripe and waiting for any God-fearing earthly pilgrims who chanced
by.
It was all there, just the other side of a fifteen-minute splice job and a cervical socket. Why endure the
cramped and smelly confines of real-life space travel to go visit pond scum on Europa?
And so, inevitably, a fourth Tribe arose, a Heavenly host that triumphed over all: the Tribe that Just
Didn't Give A Shit. They didn't know what to do when the Fireflies showed up.
So they sent us, and—in belated honor of the Historian mantra—they sent along a warrior, just in case.
It was doubtful in the extreme that any child of Earth would be a match for a race with interstellar
technology, should they prove unfriendly. Still, I could tell that Bates' presence was a comfort, to the
Human members of the crew at least. If you have to go up unarmed against an angry T-rex with a four-
digit IQ, it can't hurt to have a trained combat specialist at your side.
At the very least, she might be able to fashion a pointy stick from the branch of some convenient tree.
"I swear, if the aliens end up eating the lot of us, we'll have the Church of Game Theory to thank for
it," Sascha said.
She was grabbing a brick of couscous from the galley. I was there for the caffeine. We were more or
less alone; the rest of the crew was strewn from dome to Fab.
"Linguists don't use it?" I knew some that did.
"We don't." And the others are hacks. "Thing about game theory ^Page-84

[[Chapter-5#^Page-85]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-85
is, it assumes rational self-interest
among the players. And people just aren't rational."
"It used to assume that," I allowed. "These days they factor in the social neurology."
"Human social neurology." She bit a corner off her brick, spoke around a mouthful of semolina.
"That's what game theory's good for. Rational players, or human ones. And let me take a wild stab
here and wonder if either of those is gonna apply to that." She waved her hand at some archetypal
alien lurking past the bulkhead.
"It's got its limitations," I admitted. "I guess you use the tools you can lay your hands on."
Sascha snorted. "So if you couldn't get your hands on a proper set of blueprints, you'd base your dream
home on a book of dirty limericks."
"Maybe not." And then, a bit defensive in spite of myself, I added, "I've found it useful, though. In
areas you might not expect it to be."
"Yeah? Name one."
"Birthdays," I said, and immediately wished I hadn't.
Sascha stopped chewing. Something behind her eyes flickered, almost strobed, as if her other selves
were pricking up their ears.
"Go on," she said, and I could feel the whole Gang listening in.
"It's nothing, really. Just an example."
"So. Tell us." Sascha cocked James' head at me.
I shrugged. No point making a big thing out of it. "Well, according to game theory, you should never
tell anyone when your birthday is."
"I don't follow."
"It's a lose-lose proposition. There's no winning strategy."
"What do you mean, strategy? It's a birthday."
Chelsea had said exactly the same thing when I'd tried to explain it to her. Look, I'd said, say you tell
everyone when it is and nothing happens. It's kind of a slap in the face. ^Page-85

[[Chapter-5#^Page-86]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-86
Or suppose they throw you a party, Chelsea had replied.
Then you don't know whether they're doing it sincerely, or if your earlier interaction just guilted them
into observing an occasion they'd rather have ignored. But if you don't tell anyone, and nobody
commemorates the event, there's no reason to feel badly because after all, nobody knew. And if
someone does buy you a drink then you know it's sincere because nobody would go to all the trouble of
finding out when your birthday is— and then celebrating it—if they didn't honestly like you.
Of course, the Gang was more up to speed on such things. I didn't have to explain it verbally: I could
just grab a piece of ConSensus and plot out the payoff matrix, Tell/Don't Tell along the columns,
Celebrated/Not Celebrated along the rows, the unassailable black-and-white logic of cost and benefit
in the squares themselves. The math was irrefutable: the one winning strategy was concealment. Only
fools revealed their birthdays.
Sascha looked at me. "You ever show this to anyone else?"
"Sure. My girlfriend."
Her eyebrows lifted. "You had a girlfriend? A real one?"
I nodded. "Once."
"I mean after you showed this to her."
"Well, yes."
"Uh huh." Her eyes wandered back to the payoff matrix. "Just curious, Siri. How did she react?"
"She didn't, really. Not at first. Then—well, she laughed."
"Better woman than me." Sascha shook her head. "I'd have dumped you on the spot."
My nightly constitutional up the spine: glorious dreamy flight along a single degree of freedom. I
sailed through hatches and corridors, threw my arms wide and spun in the gentle cyclonic breezes ^Page-86

[[Chapter-5#^Page-87]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-87
of
the drum. Bates ran circles around me, bouncing her ball against bins and bulkheads, stretching to
field each curving rebound in the torqued pseudograv. The toy ricocheted off a stairwell and out of
reach as I passed; the major's curses followed me through the needle's eye from crypt to bridge.
I braked just short of the dome, stopped by the sound of quiet voices from ahead.
"Of course they're beautiful," Szpindel murmured. "They're stars."
"And I'm guessing I'm not your first choice to share the view," James said.
"You're a close second. But I've got a date with Meesh."
"She never mentioned it."
"She doesn't tell you everything. Ask her."
"Hey, this body's taking its antilibs. Even if yours isn't."
"Mind out of the gutter, Suze. Eros is only one kind of love, eh? Ancient Greeks recognized four."
"Riiight." Definitely not Susan, not any more. "Figures you'd take your lead from a bunch of
sodomites."
"Fuck, Sascha. All I'm asking is a few minutes alone with Meesh before the whip starts cracking
again..."
"My body too, Ike. You wanna pull your eyes over my wool?"
"I just want to talk, eh? Alone. That too much to ask?"
I heard Sascha take a breath.
I heard Michelle let it out.
"Sorry, kid. You know the Gang."
"Thank God. It's like some group inspection whenever I come looking for face time."
"I guess you're lucky they like you, then."
"I still say you ought to stage a coup."
"You could always move in with us."
I heard the rustle of bodies in gentle contact. "How are you?" Szpindel asked. "You okay?" ^Page-87

[[Chapter-5#^Page-88]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-88
"Pretty good. I think I'm finally used to being alive again. You?"
"Hey, I'm a spaz no matter how long I've been dead."
"You get the job done."
"Why, merci. I try."
A small silence. Theseus hummed quietly to herself.
"Mom was right," Michelle said. "They are beautiful."
"What do you see, when you look at them?" And then, catching himself: "I mean—"
"They're—prickly," Michelle told him. "When I turn my head it's like bands of very fine needles
rolling across my skin in waves. But it doesn't hurt at all. It just tingles. It's almost electric. It's nice."
"Wish I could feel it that way."
"You've got the interface. Just patch a camera into your parietal lobe instead of your visual cortex."
"That'd just tell me how a machine feels vision, eh? Still wouldn't know how you do."
"Isaac Szpindel. You're a romantic."
"Nah."
"You don't want to know. You want to keep it mysterious."
"Already got more than enough mystery to deal with out here, in case you hadn't noticed."
"Yeah, but we can't do anything about that."
"That'll change. We'll be working our asses off in no time."
"You think?"
"Count on it," Szpindel said. "So far we've just been peeking from a distance, eh? Bet all kinds of
interesting stuff happens when we get in there and start poking with a stick."
"Maybe for you. There's got to be a biological somewhere in the mix, with all those organics."
"Damn right. And you'll be talking to 'em while I'm giving them their physicals." ^Page-88

[[Chapter-5#^Page-89]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-89
"Maybe not. I mean, Mom would never admit it in a million years but you had a point about language.
When you get right down to it, it's a workaround. Like trying to describe dreams with smoke signals.
It's noble, it's maybe the most noble thing a body can do but you can't turn a sunset into a string of
grunts without losing something. It's limiting. Maybe whatever's out here doesn't even use it."
"Bet they do, though."
"Since when? You're the one who's always pointing out how inefficient language is."
"Only when I'm trying to get under your skin. Your pants—whole other thing." He laughed at his own
joke. "Seriously, what are they gonna to use instead, telepathy? I say you'll be up to your elbows in
hieroglyphics before you know it. And what's more, you'll decode 'em in record time."
"You're sweet, but I wonder. Half the time I can't even decode Jukka." Michelle fell silent a moment.
"He actually kind of throws me sometimes."
"You and seven billion others."
"Yeah. I know it's silly, but when he's not around there's a part of me that can't stop wondering where
he's hiding. And when he's right there in front of me, I feel like I should be hiding."
"Not his fault he creeps us out."
"I know. But it's hardly a big morale booster. What genius came up with the idea of putting a vampire
in charge?"
"Where else you going to put them, eh? You want to be the one giving orders to him?"
"And it's not just the way he moves. It's the way he talks. It's just wrong."
"You know he—"
"I'm not talking about the present-tense thing, or all the glottals. He—well, you know how he talks.
He's terse." ^Page-89

[[Chapter-5#^Page-90]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-90
"It's efficient."
"It's artificial, Isaac. He's smarter than all of us put together, but sometimes he talks like he's got a
fifty-word vocabulary." A soft snort. "It's not like it'd kill him to use an adverb once in a while."
"Ah. But you say that because you're a linguist, and you can't see why anyone wouldn't want to wallow
in the sheer beauty of language." Szpindel harrumphed with mock pomposity. "Now me, I'm a
biologist, so it makes perfect sense."
"Really. Then explain it to me, oh wise and powerful mutilator of frogs."
"Simple. Bloodsucker's a transient, not a resident."
"What are—oh, those are killer whales, right? Whistle dialects."
"I said forget the language. Think about the lifestyle. Residents are fish-eaters, eh? They hang out in
big groups, don't move around much, talk all the time." I heard a whisper of motion, imagined
Szpindel leaning in and laying a hand on Michelle's arm. I imagined the sensors in his gloves telling
him what she felt like. "Transients, now—they eat mammals. Seals, sea lions, smart prey. Smart
enough to take cover when they hear a fluke slap or a click train. So transients are sneaky, eh? Hunt in
small groups, range all over the place, keep their mouths shut so nobody hears 'em coming."
"And Jukka's a transient."
"Man's instincts tell him to keep quiet around prey. Every time he opens his mouth, every time he lets
u s see him, he's fighting his own brain stem. Maybe we shouldn't be too harsh on the ol' guy just
because he's not the world's best motivational speaker, eh?"
"He's fighting the urge to eat us every time we have a briefing? That's reassuring."
Szpindel chuckled. "It's probably not that bad. I guess even killer whales let their guard down after
making a kill. Why sneak around on a full stomach, eh?"
"So he's not fighting his brain stem. He just isn't hungry." ^Page-90

[[Chapter-5#^Page-91]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-91
"Probably a little of both. Brain stem never really goes away, you know. But I'll tell you one thing."
Some of the playfulness ebbed from Szpindel's voice. "I've got no problem if Sarasti wants to run the
occasional briefing from his quarters. But the moment we stop seeing him altogether? That's when you
start watching your back."
Looking back, I can finally admit it: I envied Szpindel his way with the ladies. Spliced and diced, a
gangly mass of tics and jitters that could barely feel his own skin, somehow he managed to be—
Charming. That's the word. Charming.
As a social necessity it was all but obsolete, fading into irrelevance along with two-party nonvirtual
sex pairing. But even I'd tried one of those; and it would have been nice to have had Szpindel's self-
deprecating skill set to call on.
Especially when everything with Chelsea started falling apart.
I had my own style, of course. I tried to be charming in my own peculiar way. Once, after one too
many fights about honesty and emotional manipulation, I'd started to think maybe a touch of whimsy
might smooth things over. I had come to suspect that Chelsea just didn't understand sexual politics.
Sure she'd edited brains for a living, but maybe she'd just memorized all that circuitry without giving
any thought to how it had arisen in the first place, to the ultimate rules of natural selection that had
shaped it. Maybe she honestly didn't know that we were evolutionary enemies, that all relationships
were doomed to failure. If I could slip that insight into her head— if I could charm my way past her
defenses— maybe we'd be able to hold things together.
So I thought about it, and I came up with the perfect way to raise her awareness. I wrote her a bedtime
story, a disarming blend of humor and affection, and I called it ^Page-91

The Book of Oogenesis
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life
was in balance.
And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make,
and they did flood the market.
And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea,
few of them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could
make up the shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.
And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy,
and Sperm must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally."
And it was so.
And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape.
It may breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my
one commandment unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy
genes."
And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if
sowed abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then
abandon them when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."
But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is
but half mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's
bodies were warm of blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote
myself to those, and protect them at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into
this. And though he doth struggle at my side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my
competitors." ^Page-92

[[Chapter-5#^Page-93]] ~Chapter-5 ~Page-93
And Sperm liked this not.
And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto
the day they made themselves obsolete.
I brought her flowers one dusky Tuesday evening when the light was perfect. I pointed out the irony of
that romantic old tradition— the severed genitalia of another species, offered as a precopulatory bribe
—and then I recited my story just as we were about to fuck.
To this day, I still don't know what went wrong. ^Page-93
