FOR THEY HAVE SOWN THE WIND, AND THEY SHALL REAP THE WHIRLWIND.
—HOSEA 8:7
INSIDE, THE DARKNESS was bright chaos.
Human heat signatures flickered across Brüks’s goggles at point-blank range, coruscations of false color in frantic motion. The heat of their passing painted the surroundings with fainter washes of red and yellow: rough-hewn walls, a flat dead light panel for a ceiling, a floor that yielded unexpectedly beneath his feet ^Page-38

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-39]]
like some ungodly hybrid of rubber and flesh. Off in an indeterminate distance, something stuttered and wailed; here in the hallway the human rainbows moved with silent urgency. The woman who’d invited him in—a petite writhing heatprint no more than 160 centimeters tall—grabbed his hand and pulled him forward: “I’m Lianna. Stay close.”
He followed, switching the gogs to StarlAmp. The heatprints vanished; bright greenish stars moved in the void left behind, always in pairs, binary constellations jostling and blinking in the dark. A word popped into his head: luciferin. Photophores in the retinas.
These people had eyes that doubled as flashlights. Brüks had once known a grad student with similar augments. Sex had been—disquieting, in the dark.
His guide threaded him through the starfield. That distant wailing rose and fell, rose and fell; not words exactly, but syllables at least. Clicks and cries and diphthongs in the dark. Bright eyes rose before him, seething with cold blue light. Amplified photons limned a gray face full of lines and angles. Brüks tried to steer his way around but that face blocked his way, eyes glowing with such furious intensity that his goggles had to dial back the amplification to almost nothing.
“Gelan,” the face croaked. “Thofe tessrodia.”
Brüks tried to take a step back; bumped into traffic, rebounded.
“Eptroph!” cried the face, as the body beneath gave way.
Lianna pushed him sideways into the wall—“Stay right there”—and dropped to the floor. Brüks switched back to thermal. The rainbows returned. Brüks’s assailant was on his back, heat sig bright as a solar flare, muttering nonsense. His fingers fluttered as if stabbing an invisible keyboard; his left foot tapped an agitated tattoo against the elastic flooring. Lianna cradled his head in her lap and spoke to him in the same incomprehensible tongue.
The chronic background roar of the vortex engine rose subtly in pitch. Stone trembled at Brüks’s back.
A hot bright figure appeared down the corridor, swimming ^Page-39

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-40]]
against the stream. Within moments it had reached them; Brüks’s guide passed her charge to the newcomer and was on her feet in an instant. “Let’s go.”
“What was—”
“Not here.”
A side door. A flight of stairs, sheathed in the same rubbery skin that turned their footsteps into soft squeaks. It corkscrewed down through cooling bedrock that dimmed with each step in the goggles’ sights, but that compact body glowed like a beacon ahead of him. Suddenly the world was silent again but for their own footsteps and the distant, almost subsonic thrumming of the vortex engine.
“What’s going on?” Brüks asked.
“Oh. Mahmood.” Lianna glanced back, her eyes bright garish blobs, her mouth a crimson slash of heat. “Can’t always control when the rapture hits, much less which node. Not the most convenient thing in the world but you don’t want to miss the insights, you know? Could be time travel, for all we know. Could be a cure for golem.”
“You understood what he was saying.”
“Kinda. It’s what I do, when I’m not bringing lost sheep in from the desert.”
“You’re a synthesist?” Jargonaut was the street name. Glorified translators, charged with bringing esoteric transhuman tablets down from the mountain, carved in runes simple enough for pitiful baseline Humans to half-understand.
Rhona had called them Moses mammals, back when she’d been in the world.
But Lianna was shaking her head. “Not exactly. More of a—you’re a biologist, right? Synthesists would be rats. I’m more of a koala bear.”
“Specialist.” Brüks nodded. “Narrower niche.”
“Exactly.”
A faint orange stain appeared on the thermoptics: warmth from below. ^Page-40

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-41]]
“And you know who I am because…”
“We’re on the bleeding edge of theistic virology here. You think we don’t know how to access a public database?”
“I just thought you’d have better things to look up when you were being attacked by zombies.”
“We keep an eye on the neighborhood, Dr. Brüks.”
“Yeah, but what—”
She stopped. Brüks nearly ran into her, then realized they’d reached the bottom of the stairs. Bright heat spilled around a corner dead ahead; Lianna turned and tapped his goggles. “You won’t be needing those.”
He pushed them onto his forehead. The world reverted to a dim wash of blues and grays. The rough stone to his left broke the feeble ambient light into jagged fragments; to his right the wall was smooth gray metal.
Lianna was already past him, heading back up the stairs. “I gotta go. You can watch from down here.”
“But—”
“Don’t touch anything!” she called back, and was gone.
He stepped around the corner. The ceiling panels here were as dead and dark as every other he’d seen in this place. The room—really, more of a cul-de-sac—was lit solely by a band of smart paint covering the far wall from waist-height to ceiling. It glowed with a haphazard collage of tactical displays ranging from hand-size to two meters across. Some of the feeds were coarse green mosaics; others rendered images hi-res and razor-sharp.
A man in a loose tan coverall paced back and forth before the displays, at least two meters from his fuzzy slippers (slippers?) to the cropped salt-and-pepper thicket on his head. He spared a glance as Brüks approached, muttered “Glas-not,” and turned back to the welter of intel.
Great.
Lianna the koala had told him he could watch, though. He stepped forward and tried to make sense of the chaos.
Upper-left: a satellite view so crisp it nearly hurt his eyes. The ^Page-41

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-42]]
monastery sat dead center, a bull’s-eye on the board, aglow with telltale thermal emissions. But it was the only hot spot in the whole window; whatever orbital eye he was looking through had been precisely blinded to all those other heatprints closing in the darkness. Brüks reached for the display, his fingers set to zoom the mag; a grunt and a glare from the slippered monk and he desisted.
So much for orbital surveillance. The monastery had its own cameras though, judging by the mix of StarlAmp and thermal windows looking out across the desert. They painted the nightscape in palettes from every band of the visible spectrum, cool blues and rubies intense as lasers, color schemes so chaotic Brüks wondered whether they were really functional or just a reflection of some deviant bicameral aesthetic. Candles glowed in each of those windows, and they all looked the same.
Four klicks out, and closing fast.
Something sparkled on one of the displays, a tiny bright sundog in the dead of night. The image flared a moment; bright electronic snow fuzzed the display. A brief, bright nova. Then a dark dead hole in the wall, NO SIGNAL flashing from its center.
The monk’s fingers flew across the paint, calling up keyboards, zooming displays. Windows sprouted, panned brief landscapes, evaporated in turn. Three of those views sparked and died before the Bicameral had the chance to retire them gracefully.
They’re taking out our cameras, Brüks realized, and wondered distantly when he had started to think of these rapture-stricken deviants as part of we.
Less than three and a half kilometers, now.
A new set of windows bloomed across the wall. The pictures flickering in these frames were grainier than the others, desaturated, almost monochrome. And while they too panned the desert, there was something about those views, something different yet familiar—
There. Third window over: a tiny monastery hunkered on the ^Page-42

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-43]]
horizon, a tiny vortex engine. This camera was looking back from way the hell across the desert.
That’s my network, Brüks realized. My cameras. I guess the zombies left some alive after all …
Brother Slippers had tapped into a half dozen of them, zoomed and cycled through each in turn. Brüks wasn’t sure how useful they’d be: cheap off-the-shelf things, party favors to lure impoverished researchers into springing for a package deal. They had the usual enhancements but the range was nothing special.
They seemed to be sufficient for Slippers’s purposes, though. Second window from the left, a heat source moved left to right about a hundred meters out. The camera panned automatically, tracking the target while he amped the zoom. The image resolved in slow degrees.
Another one of the monastery’s eyes flared and died, its overlaid range finder fading a moment later: 3.2 kilometers.
That’s almost nine meters per second. On foot …
“What happens when they get here?” he asked.
Slippers seemed more interested in a distant heatprint caught on number three: a small vehicle, an ATB, same basic design as—
Wait a minute—
“That’s my bike,” Brüks murmured, frowning. “That’s—me…”
Slippers spared him a glance and a head shake. “Assub.”
“No, listen—” It was far from a perfect mug shot, and Telonics’s steadicam tracking algorithms were the envy of no one in the field. But whoever sat astride that bike had Brüks’s mustache, the square lines of his face, the same multipocketed field vest that had been years out of style even when he’d inherited the damn thing two decades before. “You’re being hacked,” Brüks insisted. “That’s some kind of recording, someone must’ve—” Someone was recording me? “I mean, look at it!”
Two more cameras down. Seven so far. Slippers wasn’t even bothering to clear the real estate by closing the channels. Something else had caught his eye. He tapped the edge of a window ^Page-43

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-44]]
that looked onto a naked-eye view of the desert sky. The stars strewn across that display glittered like sugar on velvet. Brüks wanted to fall into that sky, get lost in the stark peaceful beauty of a night without tactical overlays or polarized enhancements.
But even here, the monk had found something to ruin the view: a brief flicker, a dim red nimbus framing an oval patch of starscape for the blink of an eye. The display clicked softly, an infinitesimal sharpening of focus—and in the next instant the stars returned, unsullied and pristine.
Except for a great hole in the night hanging over the western ridge, a vast dark oval where no stars shone.
Something was crawling toward them across the sky, eating the stars as it went. It was as cold as the stratosphere—at least, it didn’t show up on any of the adjacent thermal views. And it was huge; it covered a good twenty degrees of arc even though it was still—
No range finder. No heatprint. If not for whatever microlensing magic Slippers had just performed, not even this eclipse of ancient starlight would have given it away.
I, Brüks realized, have definitely picked the wrong side.
Twenty-three hundred meters. In five minutes the zombies would be knocking at the door.
“Carousel,” Slippers murmured, and something in his voice made Brüks look twice.
The monk was smiling. But he wasn’t looking at the cloaked behemoth marching across Orion’s Belt. His eyes were on a ground’s-eye view of the vortex engine. There was no audio feed; the tornado whirled silently in the StarlAmped window, a shackled green monster tearing up airspace. Brüks could hear it anyway—roaring in his memory, bending the ducts and the blades of the substructure that birthed it, vibrating through the very bedrock. He could feel it in the soles of his feet. And now Brother Slippers brought up a whole new window, a panel not of camera views or tactical overlays but of engineering readouts, laminar feed and humidity injection rates, measures of torque and velocity and compressible flow arrayed along five hundred meters of altitude. ^Page-44

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-45]]
Offset to one side a luminous wire-frame disc labeled VEC/PRIME sprouted a thousand icons around its perimeter; a hundred more described spokes and spirals toward its heart. Heating elements. Countercurrent exchangers. The devil’s own mixing board. Slippers nodded, as if to himself: “Watch.”
Icons and outputs began to move. There was nothing dramatic in the readouts, no sudden acceleration into red zones, no alarms. Just the slightest tweak of injection rates on one side of the circle; the gentlest nuzzle of convection and condensation on the other.
Over in its window, the green monster raised one toe.
Holy shit. They’re going to set it free …
A wash of readouts turned yellow; in the heart of that sudden sunny bloom, a dozen others turned orange. A couple turned red.
With ponderous, implacable majesty, the tornado lifted from the earth and stepped out across the desert.
It came down on two of the zombies. Brüks saw it all through a window that tracked the funnel’s movements across the landscape: saw the targets break and weave far faster than merely human legs could carry a body. They zigzagged, a drunkard’s sprint by undead Olympians.
They might as well have been rooted to the ground. The tornado sucked those insignificant smudges of body heat into the sky so fast they didn’t even leave an afterimage. It hesitated for a few seconds, rooted through the earth like some great elephant’s trunk. It devoured dirt and gravel and boulders the size of automobiles. Then it was off, carving its name into the desert.
Back in its garage, swirls of moisture condensed anew where the monster had broken free.
The vortex was past the undead perimeter now, veering northwest. It hopped once more, lifting its great earth-shattering foot into the air; pieces of pulverized desert rained down in its wake. A distant, disconnected subroutine in Brüks’ mind—some ganglion of logic immune to awe or fear or intimidation—wondered ^Page-45

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-46]]
at the questionable efficiency of throwing an entire weather system at two lousy foot soldiers, at the infinitesimal odds of even hitting a target on such a wild trajectory. But it fell silent in the next second, and didn’t speak again.
The whirlwind was not staggering randomly into that good night. It was bearing down on a distant figure riding an ATB.
It was coming for him.
This isn’t possible, Brüks thought. You can’t steer a tornado, nobody can. The most you can do is let it loose and get out of the way. This isn’t happening. This isn’t happening.
I am not out there …
But something was, and it knew it was being hunted. Brüks’s own hacked cameras told the tale: the ATB had abandoned its straight-line trajectory in favor of breakneck evasive maneuvers that would have instantly pitched any human rider over the handlebars. It slewed and skidded, kicked up plumes that sparkled sapphire in the amped starlight. The vortex weaved closer. They swept across the desert like partners in some wild and calamitous dance full of twirls and arabesques and impossible hairpin turns. They were never in step. Neither followed the other’s lead. And yet some invisible, unbreakable thread seemed to join the two, pulled them implacably into each other’s arms. Brüks watched, hypnotized at the sight of his own imminent ascension; the ATB was caught in orbit now around its monstrous nemesis. For a moment Brüks thought it might even break free—was it his imagination, or was the funnel thinner than it had been?—but in the next his doppelgänger lost its footing and skidded toward dissolution.
In that instant it changed.
Brüks wasn’t certain how, exactly. It would have happened too fast even if whirling debris and the grain of boosted photons hadn’t obscured the view. But it was as though the image of Daniel Brüks and his faithful steed split somehow, as if something inside was trying to shed its skin and break free, leaving a lizard-tail ^Page-46

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-47]]
husk behind for the sky-beast to chew on. The maelstrom moved in, a blizzard of rock and dust obscuring any detail. The funnel was visibly weakening now but it still had enough suction to take its quarry whole.
Still had teeth enough to smash it to fragments.
The undead broke ranks.
It wasn’t a retreat. It didn’t even seem to be a coordinated exercise. The candles just stopped advancing and flickered back and forth in their windows, nine hundred meters out, directionless and Brownian. Far behind them the sated whirlwind weaved away to the north, a dissipating ropy thing, nearly exhausted.
“Dymic.” Slippers nodded knowingly. “Assub.”
Back on the pad a newborn vortex chafed at its restraints, smaller than its predecessor but angrier, somehow. Yellow icons blossomed across VEC/PRIME like rampant brushfires. Overhead, something was eating Gemini feetfirst.
Another window opened on the wall, a hodgepodge of emerald alphanumerics. Slippers blinked and frowned, as though the apparition was somehow unexpected. Greek equations, Cyrillic footnotes, even a smattering of English flowed across the new display.
Not telemetry. Not incoming. According to the status bar, this was an outgoing transmission; the Bicamerals were signaling someone. It all flickered by too fast for Brüks to have made much sense of it even if he had spoken Russian, but occasional fragments of English stuck in his eye. Theseus was one. Icarus another. Something about angels and asteroids flashed center stage for a moment and evaporated.
More glyphs, more numbers: three parallel columns this time, rendered in red. Someone talking back.
Out in the desert, the zombies stopped flickering.
“Huh,” Slippers said, and raised a finger to his right temple. For the first time Brüks noticed an old-fashioned earbud there, an audio antique from the days before cortical inlays and bone conduction. Slippers inclined his head, listening; up on the wall a flurry ^Page-47

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-48]]
of red and green turned the ongoing exchange into a Christmas celebration.
Over on VEC/PRIME, orange and red icons downshifted to yellow. The chained vortex stopped thrashing on its pad and whirled smoothly at attention. Halfway to the horizon, the last vestiges of its older sibling dissipated in a luminous mist of settling dust.
The desert rested quietly beneath an invisible thing in the sky.
Just a few minutes ago, Dan Brüks had watched himself die out there. Or maybe escape in the nick of time. Something like him, anyway. Right up until that last moment when the maelstrom had chewed it up and spat it out. And right at that moment, the zombies had come—unglued …
Assub, Slippers had said then. At least, that’s what Brüks had heard. Assub.
Ass—hub?
“A.S.?” he said aloud. Brother Slippers turned, raised an eyebrow.
“A.S.,” Brüks repeated. “What’s it stand for?”
“Artificial Stupidity. Grabs local surveillance archives to blend in. Chameleon response.”
“But why me? Why”—in the sky, invisible airships—“why anything? Why not just cloak, like that thing up there?”
“Can’t cloak thermal emissions without overheating,” Slippers told him. “Not for long at least, not if you’re an endotherm. Best you can do is make yourself look like something else. Dynamic mimicry.”
Dymic.
Brüks snorted, shook his head. “You’re not even Bicameral, are you?”
Slippers smiled faintly. “You thought I was?”
“It’s a monastery. You spoke like…”
Slippers shook his head. “Just visiting.”
Acronyms. “You’re military,” Brüks guessed.
“Something like that.”
“Dan Brüks,” he said, extending a hand. ^Page-48

[[Echopraxia-Chapter-3#^Page-49]]
The other man looked at it for a moment. Reached out his own. “Jim Moore. Welcome to the armistice.”
“What just happened?”
“They came to terms. For the moment.”
“They?”
“The monks and the vampire.”
“I thought those were zombies.”
“Those are.” Moore tapped the wall; a heat source appeared in the distance, a lone bright pinprick well behind the line. “That isn’t. Zombies don’t do anything without someone pulling their strings. She’s coming in now.”
“Vampires,” Brüks said.
“Vampire. Solitary op.” And then, almost as an afterthought, “Those things aren’t good in groups.”
“I didn’t even know we let them out. I actually thought we were pretty scrupulous about keeping them, you know. Contained.”
“So did I.” Pale flickering light washed the color from Moore’s face. “Not quite sure what her story is.”
“What’s she have against the Bicamerals?”
“I don’t know.”
“Why did she stop?”
“Enemy of my enemy.”
Brüks let that sink in. “You’re saying there’s a bigger enemy out there. A, a common threat.”
“Potentially.”
Out in the desert, that dimensionless point of heat had grown large enough to move on visible legs. It did not appear to be running, yet somehow crossed the desert far faster than any baseline was likely to walk.
“So I guess I can go now,” Brüks said.
The old soldier turned to face him. Regret mingled with the tactical reflections in his eyes.
“Not a chance,” he said. ^Page-49
