"Species used to go extinct. Now they go on hiatus."
—Deborah MacLennan, Tables of our Reconstruction
"You poor guy," Chelsea said as we went our separate ways. "Sometimes I don't think you'll ever be
lonely." At the time I wondered why she sounded so sad.
Now, I only wish she'd been right.
I know this hasn't been a seamless narrative. I've had to shatter the story and string its fragments out
along a death lasting decades. I live for only an hour of every ten thousand now, you see. I wish I
didn't have to. If only I could sleep the whole way back, avoid the agony of these brief time-lapsed
resurrections.
If only I wouldn't die in my sleep if I tried. But living bodies glitter with a lifetime's accumulation of
embedded radioisotopes, brilliant little shards that degrade cellular machinery at the molecular level.
It's not usually a problem. Living cells repair the damage as fast as it occurs. But my undead ones let
those errors accumulate over time, and the journey home takes so much longer than the trip out: I lie
in stasis and corrode. So the onboard kick-starts me every now and then to give my flesh the chance to
stitch itself back together.
Occasionally it talks to me, recites system stats, updates me on any chatter from back home. Mostly,
though, it leaves me alone with my thoughts and the machinery ticking away where my left ^Page-357

[[Chapter-24#^Page-358]] 
hemisphere used to be. So I talk to myself, dictate history and opinion from real hemisphere to
synthetic one: bright brief moments of awareness, long years of oblivious decay between. Maybe the
whole exercise is pointless from the start, maybe no one's even listening.
It doesn't matter. This is what I do.
So there you have it: a memoir told from meat to machinery. A tale told to myself, for lack of
someone else to take an interest.
Anyone with half a brain could tell it.
I got a letter from Dad today. General delivery, he called it. I think that was a joke, in deference to my
lack of known address. He just threw it omnidirectionally into the ether and hoped it would wash over
me, wherever I was.
It's been almost fourteen years now. You lose track of such things out here.
Helen's dead. Heaven—malfunctioned, apparently. Or was sabotaged. Maybe the Realists finally
pulled it off. I doubt it, though. Dad seemed to think someone else was responsible. He didn't offer up
any details. Maybe he didn't know any. He spoke uneasily of increasing unrest back home. Maybe
someone leaked my communiqués about Rorschach; maybe people drew the obvious conclusion when
our postcards stopped arriving. They don't know how the story ended. The lack of closure must be
driving them crazy.
But I got the sense there was something else, something my father didn't dare speak aloud. Maybe it's
just my imagination; I thought he even sounded troubled by the news that the birth rate was rising
again, which should be cause for celebration after a generation in decline. If my Chinese Room was
still in proper working order I'd know, I'd be able to parse it down to the punctuation. But Sarasti
battered my tools and left them barely functional. I'm as blind now as any baseline. All I have is
uncertainty and suspicion, ^Page-358

[[Chapter-24#^Page-359]] 
and the creeping dread that even with my best tricks in tatters, I might be
reading him right.
I think he's warning me to stay away.
He also said he loved me. He said he missed Helen, that she was sorry for something she did before I
was born, some indulgence or omission that carried developmental consequences. He rambled. I don't
know what he was talking about. So much power my father must have had, to be able to authorize such
a broadcast and yet waste so much of it on feelings.
Oh God, how I treasure it. I treasure every word.
I fall along an endless futile parabola, all gravity and inertia. Charybdis couldn't reacquire the
antimatter stream; Icarus has either been knocked out of alignment or shut off entirely. I suppose I
could radio ahead and ask, but there's no hurry. I'm still a long way out. It will be years before I even
leave the comets behind.
Besides, I'm not sure I want anyone to know where I am.
Charybdis doesn't bother with evasive maneuvers. There'd be no point even if it had the fuel to spare,
even if the enemy's still out there somewhere. It's not as though they don't know where Earth is.
But I'm pretty sure the scramblers went up along with my own kin. They played well. I admit it freely.
Or maybe they just got lucky. An accidental hiccough tickles Bates' grunt into firing on an unarmed
scrambler; weeks later, Stretch & Clench use that body in the course of their escape. Electricity and
magnetism stir random neurons in Susan's head; further down the timeline a whole new persona erupts
to take control, to send Theseus diving into Rorschach's waiting arms. Blind stupid random chance.
Maybe that's all it was. ^Page-359

[[Chapter-24#^Page-360]] 
But I don't think so. Too many lucky coincidences. I think Rorschach made its own luck, planted and
watered that new persona right under our noses, safely hidden—but for the merest trace of elevated
oxytocin— behind all the lesions and tumors sewn in Susan's head. I think it looked ahead and saw the
uses to which a decoy might be put; I think it sacrificed a little piece of itself in furtherance of that
end, and made it look like an accident. Blind maybe, but not luck. Foresight. Brilliant moves, and
subtle.
Not that most of us even knew the rules of the game, of course. We were just pawns, really. Sarasti
and the Captain—whatever hybridized intelligence those two formed—they were the real players.
Looking back, I can see a few of their moves too. I see Theseus hearing the scramblers tap back and
forth in their cages; I see her tweak the volume on the Gang's feed so that Susan hears it too, and
thinks the discovery her own. If I squint hard enough, I even glimpse Theseus offering us up in
sacrifice, deliberately provoking Rorschach to retaliation with that final approach. Sarasti was always
enamored of data, especially when it had tactical significance. What better way to assess one's enemy
than to observe it in combat?
They never told us, of course. We were happier that way. We disliked orders from machines. Not that
we were all that crazy about taking them from a vampire.
And now the game is over, and a single pawn stands on that scorched board and its face is human after
all. If the scramblers follow the rules that a few generations of game theorists have laid out for them,
they won't be back. Even if they are, I suspect it won't make any difference.
Because by then, there won't be any basis for conflict.
I've been listening to the radio during these intermittent awakenings. It's been generations since we
buried the Broadcast Age in tightbeams and fiberop, but we never completely stopped sowing EM
throughout the heavens. Earth, Mars, and Luna conduct their interplanetary trialog in a million
overlapping voices. Every ship ^Page-360

[[Chapter-24#^Page-361]] 
cruising the void speaks in all directions at once. The O'Neils and the
asteroids never stopped singing. The Fireflies might never have found us if they had.
I've heard those songs changing over time, a fast-forward time-lapse into oblivion. Now it's mostly
traffic control and telemetry. Every now and then I still hear a burst of pure voice, tight with tension,
just short of outright panic more often than not: some sort of pursuit in progress, a ship making the
plunge into deep space, other ships in dispassionate pursuit. The fugitives never seem to get very far
before their signals are cut off.
I can't remember the last time I heard music but I hear something like it sometimes, eerie and
discordant, full of familiar clicks and pops. My brainstem doesn't like it. It scares my brainstem to
death.
I remember my whole generation abandoning the real world for a bootstrapped Afterlife. I remember
someone saying Vampires don't go to Heaven . They see the pixels. Sometimes I wonder how I'd feel,
brought back from the peace of the grave to toil at the pleasure of simpleminded creatures who had
once been no more than protein. I wonder how I'd feel if my disability had been used to keep me
leashed and denied my rightful place in the world.
And then I wonder what it would be like to feel nothing at all, to be an utterly rational, predatory
creature with meat putting itself so eagerly to sleep on all sides...
I can't miss Jukka Sarasti. God knows I try, every time I come online. He saved my life. He —
humanized me. I'll always owe him for that, for however long I live; and for however long I live I'll
never stop hating him for the same reason. In some sick surrealistic way I had more in common with
Sarasti than I did with any human.
But I just don't have it in me. He was a predator and I was prey, and it's not in the nature of the lamb to
mourn the lion. Though he died for our sins, I cannot miss Jukka Sarasti. ^Page-361

[[Chapter-24#^Page-362]] 
I can empathize with him, though. At long long last I can empathise, with Sarasti, with all his extinct
kind. Because we humans were never meant to inherit the Earth. Vampires were. They must have been
sentient to some degree, but that semi-aware dream state would have been a rudimentary thing next to
our own self-obsession. They were weeding it out. It was just a phase. They were on their way.
The thing is, humans can look at crosses without going into convulsions. That's evolution for you; one
stupid linked mutation and the whole natural order falls apart, intelligence and self-awareness stuck in
counterproductive lock-step for half a million years. I think I know what's happening back on Earth,
and though some might call it genocide it isn't really. We did it to ourselves. You can't blame
predators for being predators. We were the ones who brought them back, after all. Why wouldn't they
reclaim their birthright?
Not genocide. Just the righting of an ancient wrong.
I've tried to take some comfort in that. It's—difficult. Sometimes it seems as though my whole life's
been a struggle to reconnect, to regain whatever got lost when my parents killed their only child. Out
in the Oort, I finally won that struggle. Thanks to a vampire and a boatload of freaks and an invading
alien horde, I'm Human again. Maybe the last Human. By the time I get home, I could be the only
sentient being in the universe.
If I'm even that much. Because I don't know if there is such a thing as a reliable narrator. And
Cunningham said zombies would be pretty good at faking it.
So I can't really tell you, one way or the other.
You'll just have to imagine you're Siri Keeton. ^Page-362
