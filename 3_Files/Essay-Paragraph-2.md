Chinese Rooms (Siri Keeton)

In Blindsight (2006) and Echopraxia (2014) central of the first is whether conscioussness is a disability while the focus of the second is the transcending of this disability through augmentation. The anxities of being obsolete are touched briefly phrased by Robert Cunnigham, "We can be utterly useless, or we can try and compete against the vampires and the constructs and the AIs" (Watts 251) . In Echopraxia, this anxiety is compounded through the introduction of Bicammerals, hive-minded super monks who induce the disability controlled brain cancer (Watts, Echopraxia 179) and pruding of their individual identities until their sense of self . ()

We see that Siri Keeton struggles with being in touch with his former identity pre-hemisphrectomy and emotions as his over-reliance on his Chinese Room, a set of unconcious protocols  . "I really wanted to talk to her. I just couldn't find an algorithm that fit." (Watts 293)

Siri undergoes another physical disability "Get out of your room, Keeton [...] For once in your goddamned life, understand something"(Watts 300)

Daniel Bruks goes in the opposite direction of Siri Keaton, moving from a concious person: refusing augmentation due to fears of self taking everything empiraclly an nothing based on faith "Even in sleep, Dan Brüks didn’t take anything on faith" (Watts, Echopraxia 69)
