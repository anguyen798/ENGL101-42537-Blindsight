When Sasha tells Rorschach to “Suck[…] dick,”she’s purposefully escalating the initial contact between it and her crew because she believes that Rorschach is "just a Chinese Room”, a reference that connects [[ChineseRoom_1#^1]] to the notable quote a few pages earlier from Robert Hare’s Without Conscience (1993) [[ChineseRoom_1^3]]. The Hare quote “They know the music but not the words”is notable not only for its approximation of the Chinese Room(II) that famous thought experiment where a person can learn and use a language without understanding what their words mean, but also because of the source(III); it is where the early Ted Bundy quote that opens the novel encourages the reader to ignore the past as it's "only a dream” is located(IV).
