Imagine you are aboard the space ship Theseus one of the crew on the bleeding edge of humanity augmented to give yourself in edge in dealing with Rorschach, a alien space vessel "a crown of thorns" (Watts, Blindsight 124 or 124) . First contact with scramblers, Rorsarch's non-sentient octopoid inhabitants, creates the misinterpretation of an alien race of disabled cells-with-Waldoes (226). Later their intelligence through processing speed far exceeds that of even the vampire captain Jukka Sarasti and coincidentally both share aspects of non-sentience (309). You slowly realize that your consciousness, that voice in your head, is an evolutionary fluke, a parasite and a disability that causes your communication to be misinterpreted as a senseless waste of resources and therefore an act of war (324). Rorsarch then attacks by exploiting the disabilities of the Theseus crew. It continues its pattern of killing essential medical personnel with Issac Szpindel (195), finishing off Robert Cunningham and disabling the Theseus crew by cutting off your escape (330). Susan James multi-core augmentation is supplanted by a new panicking personality (341) followed by Jukka Sarasti's pattern processing strength turning into a disability due to the crucifix glitch an overload when right angles take up the majority of the vampire visual field and possibly Susan spiking his anti-Euclidian drugs that treat the seizures (345). When all hope appears to be lost, it is Amanda Bates's act noble self-sacrifice that allows the Theseus crew to defeat Rorsarch by mutually assured destruction, actions of a disabled mind the unconscious beings cannot comprehend due to following a set of rules to maximize their survival (350). You have just imagined that you are Siri Keeton.

cursed with comprehension that consciousness is an evolutionary disability and only to regain it on the return trip to Earth.
