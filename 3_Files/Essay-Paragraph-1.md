Are empathy and consciousness - traits that define our humanity -- actually disabilities? Imagine you're a character living in the novel Blindsight (2014) by Peter Watts. In the novel vampires and supercomputers run rings around humans to the point of making them seem disabled. These normal humans called baselines treat normalcy or humanity like a disease, the treatment through augmentation. Akin to natural selection, those at the top and on the Theseus are all augmented, the augments imitating aspects are modern day disabilities and disorders. This is found in Crew of the Theseus augments or disabilities: Siri (processing without comprehension), Sarasti (dependency on anti-euclidians), James (only one personality being on top), Szpindel and Cunnigham (putting themselves into objects) and Bates (). Baselines who choose not to Disabled characters As we later find out in the novel scramblers are extraterrestrial aliens living on the vessel Rorsarch but are mistaken as "Waldos with cells", underestimated because they do not appear to be capable of conciousness. It is revealed later in the novel that the lack of conciousness may not be such a disability as it seems but that concioussness itself is a disability, where the majority of extraterrestrial life lacks conciousness and humanity with conciousness is compared to flightless birds, succeding due more to isolation.
