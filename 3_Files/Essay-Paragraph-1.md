Story of how the Theseus Crew's disabilities after they are attacked by Rorsarch

Are empathy and consciousness - traits that define our humanity -- actually disabilities? Imagine you're a character living in the novel Blindsight (2014) by Peter Watts. In the novel vampires and supercomputers run rings around humans to the point of making them seem disabled. These normal humans called baselines treat normalcy or humanity like a disease, the treatment through augmentation. Akin to natural selection, those at the top and on the Theseus are all augmented, the augments imitating aspects are modern day disabilities and disorders. This is found in Crew of the Theseus augments or disabilities: Siri (processing without comprehension), Sarasti (dependency on anti-euclidians), James (only one personality being on top), Szpindel and Cunnigham (putting themselves into objects) and Bates (). Baselines who choose not to Disabled characters As we later find out in the novel scramblers are extraterrestrial aliens living on the vessel Rorsarch but are mistaken as "Waldos with cells", underestimated because they do not appear to be capable of conciousness. It is revealed later in the novel that the lack of conciousness may not be such a disability as it seems but that concioussness itself is a disability, where the majority of extraterrestrial life lacks conciousness and humanity with conciousness is compared to flightless birds, succeding due more to isolation.


Imagine you are aboard the space Theseus, its crew the bleeding edge of humanity augmented to give yourself in edge in dealing with Rorschach, a juvenille alien organic space vessel which appears to be unprepared and still growing. First contact with scramblers, Rorsarch's non-sentient octopoid inhabitants, creates the misinterpretation of a alien race of disabled cells-with-Waldoes (Watts 226). Later their intelligence through processing speed far exceeds that of even the vampire captain Jukka Sarasti and coincidentally both share aspects of non-sentience (Watts 309). Your conciousness is an evolutionary fluke, a parasite and a disability that causes your communication to be misinterpreated as a senseless waste of resources and therefore an act of war (Watts 324). Rorsarch attacks by exploiting the disabilities of the Theseus crew. It continues its pattern of killing essential medical personel with Issac Szpindel (Watts 195) finishing Robert Cunningham and disabling the Theseus crew (Watts 330). Susan James multi-core augment is supplanted by a new panicking personality (Watts 341) followed by Jukka Sarasti's pattern processing strength turning into a disability due to the crucifix glitch an overload when right angles take up the majority of the vampire visual field and possibly Susan spiking his anti-euclidian drugs that treat the seizures (Watts 345). When hope appears to be lost, it is Amanda Bates's disability of being a consciouss being allows the Theseus crew to defeat Rorsarch due to self-sacrifice by turning on the self-destruct reactor, something the unconscious beings cannot comprehend (Page 350). Left is Siri Keeton, which we have just imagined ourselves being, with the insight that consciousness is an evolutionary disability and only to regain it on the return trip to Earth.
