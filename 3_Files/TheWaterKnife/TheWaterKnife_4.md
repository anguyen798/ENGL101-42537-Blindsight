When Angel attacks the fictional Carver City[[TheWaterKnife_1#^2]] on behalf of Catherine Case and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) in Chapter 1 of The Water Knife (2015) [[TheWaterKnife_1#^1]], he's not simply destroying a water resource for the denziens of the novel; the city's name evokes the agricultural scientist George Washington Carver, who prompted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion [[TheWaterKnife_1#^3]], and the helicopters launched for the equally-fictional Mulroy Airbase [[TheWaterKnife_1#^4]] channels the very real SNWA Patricia Mulroy [[TheWaterKnife_1#^7]], who in the 1990s, "had one paramount mission [[TheWaterKnife_1#^5]]: to find more water for Las Vegas and use it to help the city keep expanding". Mulroy also acts in many ways as a prototype for Angel's boss, Catherine Case, an even more aggresive SNWA water administrator who will stop at nothing to secure water for Las Vegas [[TheWaterKnife_1#^6]]
