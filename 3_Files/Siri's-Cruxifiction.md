Like Christ, he is crucified unjustly; his smilies suggest he may be a savior figure

His imagry recalls that of the geckoed (sp) tortuers killed by a P.O.W. Amanda Bates Freed

>Matthew 5:30
Matthew 5:30 part where Jesus tells to cut away parts of onself that are sinful... hands... etc

Ironic that it's a Vamp doing the crucifixtion & that crosses are their Achilles Heel
